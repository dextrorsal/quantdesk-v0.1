# Smart Contract Implementation Archive

This directory contains archived implementations that were consolidated into the primary implementation.

## Archive Structure

### `implementations/`
Contains previous implementations that were replaced:

- **`current-implementation/`** - Previous implementation with stack overflow issues
  - Program ID: `C2T3UnvGdHwEkspXJG7JyAhwo6VKQEKjN6eCq69guYSw`
  - Issues: Stack overflow in KeeperSecurityManager (12KB+ usage)
  - Arrays: `authorized_keepers: [KeeperAuth; 3]`, `liquidation_history: [LiquidationRecord; 5]`
  - Status: ❌ Not production ready due to stack overflow

### `references/`
Contains reference implementations used for consolidation:

- **`expert-analysis-reference/`** - Expert analysis implementation (now primary)
  - Program ID: `C2T3UnvGdHwEkspXJG7JyAhwo6VKQEKjN6eCq69guYSw`
  - Features: Most complete feature set, optimized for production
  - Arrays: `authorized_keepers: [KeeperAuth; 20]`, `liquidation_history: [LiquidationRecord; 50]`
  - Status: ✅ Production ready (now active implementation)

### `backups/`
Contains backup files and temporary files:

- **`lib.rs.backup`** - Backup of lib.rs file

## Current Active Implementation

The current active implementation is located in:
`contracts/programs/quantdesk-perp-dex/src/`

This is the consolidated Expert Analysis Implementation with:
- ✅ Production-scale arrays
- ✅ Enhanced security features
- ✅ Complete trading functionality
- ✅ Optimized stack usage
- ✅ Backend compatibility maintained

## Consolidation Summary

## Notes

- All archived implementations are kept for reference only
- Do not use archived implementations for development
- The active implementation is the single source of truth
- Archive implementations may have stack overflow issues or missing features
