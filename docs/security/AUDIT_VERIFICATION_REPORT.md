## Phase 3: Smart Contract Analysis

### 3.1 Compilation Status ⚠️ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

**Status:** Compilation errors present but documented

**Key Issues Found:**
1. **Duplicate INIT_SPACE Definitions** (2 errors)
   - `CollateralAccount` and `Position` structs have conflicting constants
   - Recommendation: Consolidate or use separate account types

2. **Missing Fields in Position Struct** (8 errors)
   - Code references `margin`, `user`, `created_at`, `collateral_accounts`, `total_collateral_value`
   - Current struct missing these fields

3. **Type Mismatches** (3 errors)
   - i64 vs u64 conversion issues in funding calculations
   - Recommendation: Use checked arithmetic operations

4. **Borrowing Conflicts** (3 errors)
   - E0502 errors with mutable/immutable borrows
   - Recommendation: Separate read/write operations

### 3.2 Solana MCP Expert Recommendations ✅ RECEIVED

**From Solana Expert Analysis:**
- Use separate account types for different position types
- Implement proper margin management with checked arithmetic
- Add comprehensive account constraints for security
- Use PDA validation with seeds and bump constraints
- Implement robust liquidation mechanisms

**From Anchor Framework Expert:**
- Consolidate duplicate INIT_SPACE definitions
