# GitHub Security Audit Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to use GitHub's built-in security features for dependency auditing and vulnerability management.

## GitHub Security Features

### 1. Dependabot Alerts
- Automatically detects vulnerable dependencies
- Suggests updates to fix security issues
- Configurable update schedules

### 2. Code Scanning (CodeQL)
- Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- Customizable security rules
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

### 3. Secret Scanning
- Detects exposed secrets in repositories
- Real-time scanning of commits
- Push protection to prevent secret leaks

### 4. Security Advisories
- Global vulnerability database
- Community-driven security information
- Integration with package managers

## Configuration Example

```json
{
  "GitHub": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
    "env": {
      "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE"
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Enable all security features in repository settings
2. Regularly review and update dependencies
3. Use automated security scanning in CI/CD
4. Monitor security alerts and respond promptly
5. Keep personal access tokens secure and rotated

## Getting Started

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to Security & analysis
3. Enable Dependabot alerts
4. Set up CodeQL analysis
5. Configure secret scanning
