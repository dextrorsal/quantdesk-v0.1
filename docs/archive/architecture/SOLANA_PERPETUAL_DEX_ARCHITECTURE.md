# Solana Perpetual DEX Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete architecture for building a Solana-based perpetual DEX similar to Drift Protocol. The system involves multiple interconnected components that must work together seamlessly.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. User Account Lifecycle

#### State Flow:
```
Wallet Connection → Account Creation → Deposit → Trading → Withdrawal
```

#### Detailed States:
1. **Disconnected State**: User needs to connect wallet
2. **Connected, No Account**: Wallet connected but no trading account created
3. **Account Created, No Deposits**: Account exists but no collateral deposited
4. **Account with Deposits**: Ready for trading with sufficient collateral
5. **Active Trading**: User has open positions
6. **Risk State**: Positions approaching liquidation

### 2. Smart Contract Architecture

#### Core Programs:
- **User Account Program**: Manages individual user accounts
- **Collateral Vault Program**: Handles deposits/withdrawals
- **Trading Program**: Manages order matching and position management
- **Oracle Program**: Price feed management
- **Insurance Fund Program**: Risk management and liquidation

#### Account Structure:
```
User Account
├── Master Account (Main wallet)
├── Trading Accounts (Sub-accounts)
├── Collateral Balances
├── Open Positions
├── Order History
└── Risk Metrics
```

### 3. Backend Components

#### Database Schema:
- **Users**: Master account information
- **Trading Accounts**: Sub-account management
- **Deposits/Withdrawals**: Transaction history
- **Positions**: Open trading positions
- **Orders**: Order book and history
- **Balances**: Asset balances per account
- **Risk Metrics**: Margin ratios, liquidation prices

#### API Endpoints:
- **Authentication**: Wallet connection and signing
- **Account Management**: Create/update accounts
- **Deposit/Withdrawal**: Asset transfers
- **Trading**: Order placement and management
- **Risk Management**: Position monitoring
- **Data Feeds**: Real-time market data

### 4. Frontend State Management

#### State Machine:
```typescript
interface UserState {
  walletConnected: boolean;
  accountCreated: boolean;
  hasDeposits: boolean;
  canTrade: boolean;
  riskLevel: 'safe' | 'warning' | 'danger';
}
```

#### UI Components:
- **Wallet Connection Modal**
- **Account Creation Flow**
- **Deposit Modal**
- **Trading Interface**
- **Position Management**
- **Risk Dashboard**
