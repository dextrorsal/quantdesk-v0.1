# QuantDesk Security Improvements Summary

## 🛡️ Completed Security Improvements

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Major security vulnerabilities addressed

---

## 1. ✅ Exposed Secrets Removed

### Critical: Supabase Service Key Exposure
- **Status:** ✅ Handled by user (rotating key)
- **Location:** `data-ingestion/env.example`
- **Action:** User is rotating the exposed key and updating all environments
- **Impact:** Prevents unauthorized access to Supabase database

---

## 2. ✅ Critical Dependencies Updated

### Backend Dependencies
**Updated packages:**
- ✅ `elliptic`: Updated from 6.6.0 (CRITICAL vulnerability fixed)
- ✅ `serialize-javascript`: Updated (MEDIUM vulnerability fixed)
- ⚠️ `bigint-buffer`: Requires breaking change (see below)

### Frontend Dependencies
**Updated packages:**
- ✅ `elliptic`: Updated from 6.6.0 (CRITICAL vulnerability fixed)
- ⚠️ `bigint-buffer`: Requires breaking change (see below)
- ⚠️ `esbuild`: Requires breaking change (see below)

### Admin Dashboard Dependencies
**Updated packages:**
- ✅ `@babel/helpers`: Updated to 7.26.10+ (MODERATE vulnerability fixed)
- ✅ `@babel/runtime`: Updated to 7.26.10+ (MODERATE vulnerability fixed)
- ✅ `@eslint/plugin-kit`: Updated to 0.3.4+ (LOW/MODERATE vulnerabilities fixed)
- ✅ `cross-spawn`: Updated to 7.0.5+ (HIGH ReDoS vulnerability fixed)
- ✅ `brace-expansion`: Updated (MODERATE ReDoS vulnerability fixed)
- ✅ `nanoid`: Updated to 3.3.8+ (MODERATE vulnerability fixed)
- ⚠️ `esbuild`: Requires breaking change (see below)

**Results:**
- Backend: 3 HIGH vulnerabilities remaining (bigint-buffer chain)
- Frontend: 5 vulnerabilities remaining (2 MODERATE, 3 HIGH)
- Admin: 2 MODERATE vulnerabilities remaining (esbuild chain)

---

## 3. ⚠️ Remaining Vulnerabilities (Require Manual Review)

### High Priority: bigint-buffer (HIGH severity)
**Issue:** Buffer overflow vulnerability in `bigint-buffer` package  
**Affected:** Frontend, Backend  
**Fix Available:** `npm audit fix --force` (breaking change)  
**Impact:** Will downgrade `@solana/spl-token` from current version to 0.1.8  

**Recommendation:**
```bash
# Test in development first
cd frontend && npm audit fix --force
cd ../backend && npm audit fix --force

# Verify Solana integration still works
npm test
```

**Why not auto-fixed:** This is a breaking change that affects Solana integration. Needs manual testing to ensure SPL token functionality remains intact.

### Medium Priority: esbuild (MODERATE severity)
**Issue:** Development server can accept requests from any website  
**Affected:** Frontend, Admin Dashboard  
**Fix Available:** `npm audit fix --force` (breaking change)  
**Impact:** Will upgrade Vite to v7.1.8 (may have breaking changes)  

**Recommendation:**
```bash
# Test in development first
cd admin-dashboard && npm audit fix --force

# Verify build process and dev server still work
npm run dev
npm run build
```

**Why not auto-fixed:** This only affects development servers. Production builds are not vulnerable. The fix requires Vite v7 which may have breaking changes in the build process.

## 4. ⚠️ CodeQL Alerts: CDN Scripts Without SRI

### Issue: 186 Code Scanning Alerts
**Category:** Untrusted CDN script inclusions  
**Location:** All `docs-site/html/*.html` files (generated documentation)  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (if attacker compromises CDN)  

**Affected CDN Resources:**
- `cdnjs.cloudflare.com` - Prism.js, Font Awesome
- `cdn.jsdelivr.net` - Mermaid.js

**Why This Exists:**
These are **generated HTML documentation files** created by the documentation build process. They are not production application code.

### Recommendations:

#### Option 1: Accept Risk (Recommended for Docs)
Since these are static documentation files served locally:
- Risk is minimal (attacker would need to compromise CDN AND user's network)
- Files are regenerated from source, not hand-edited
- Adding SRI to 96 generated files is impractical

#### Option 2: Self-Host CDN Resources
```bash
# Download and serve locally
mkdir -p docs-site/assets/{js,css}
wget -O docs-site/assets/css/prism.min.css https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.29.0/themes/prism-tomorrow.min.css
wget -O docs-site/assets/js/prism.min.js https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.29.0/components/prism-core.min.js
# Update HTML templates to use local paths
```

#### Option 3: Add SRI Attributes
If you want to add SRI to the documentation build templates:
```bash
# Generate SRI hashes
echo "sha384-$(curl -s https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.29.0/themes/prism-tomorrow.min.css | openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | base64)"
```

Update the documentation template (likely in `docs-site/convert_markdown.py` or similar).

## 5. ✅ GitHub Security Features Status

### Dependabot Alerts
- **Status:** ⚠️ Disabled in repository settings
- **Recommendation:** Enable in GitHub repository settings
- **Action:** Go to Settings → Security → Code security and analysis → Enable Dependabot

### Code Scanning (CodeQL)
- **Status:** ⚠️ Not configured
- **Recommendation:** Set up CodeQL workflow
- **Action:** Create `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`:

```yaml
name: "CodeQL"

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 1'

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      security-events: write

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        language: [ 'javascript', 'typescript' ]

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
      with:
        languages: ${{ matrix.language }}

    - name: Autobuild
      uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v3

    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
```

### Secret Scanning
