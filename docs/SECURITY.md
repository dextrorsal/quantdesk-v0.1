# Security Policy

## üîí QuantDesk Security Overview

QuantDesk implements enterprise-grade security measures to protect user funds, trading data, and platform integrity. This document outlines our security policies, procedures, and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Multi-Layer Security Architecture
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against various attack vectors
- **Zero Trust Model**: All access is verified and logged
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users and systems have minimal required access
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security event monitoring and alerting

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all administrative access
- **JWT Token Security**: Secure token-based authentication with short expiration
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permission management
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic timeout

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted using AES-256
- **Encryption in Transit**: All communications use TLS 1.3
- **Database Security**: Row-level security (RLS) and encrypted connections
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and SQL injection protection

### Smart Contract Security
- **Audited Contracts**: All smart contracts undergo professional security audits
- **Formal Verification**: Critical functions verified using formal methods
- **Upgrade Mechanisms**: Secure upgrade patterns for contract improvements
- **Oracle Protection**: Dynamic staleness protection and price validation
