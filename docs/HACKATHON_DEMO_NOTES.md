### Part 3: Core Trading Flow (2.5 mins)

#### Step 1: Connect Wallet (15 seconds)
**Actions:**
1. Open `http://localhost:3001`
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Approve Phantom/Solflare connection

**Talking Points:**

3. Confirm deposit
4. Wait for confirmation

**Talking Points:**
- "Depositing 0.45 SOL (worth ~$93 USD at current prices)"

- "Collateral stored as USD (6 decimals) for accurate accounting"

**Expected Result:**
```
Total Collateral: $93.15 USD ✅
NOT: 7,619,097 SOL ❌ (the bug we fixed!)
```

**Show in Browser Console:**
```
💰 USD collateral value from account data: 93.15 USD
📊 Raw value (6 decimals): 93150000
🔍 Conversion check: value / 1e6 = 93.15
```

---

#### Step 4: View Account Info (30 seconds)
**Actions:**
1. Open Account Slide-Out
2. Show collateral display
3. Show account health

**What to Highlight:**
```
Total Collateral: $93.15 USD  ← Correct USD display!
Account Health: 100%
Trading Status: Active
```

**Talking Points:**
- "Accurate USD-denominated display"
- "Fixed critical bug: was showing lamports as USD"
- "Following Drift Protocol patterns"
- "Used decimal.js for precise conversions"

---

### Part 4: Technical Deep Dive (1 min)

**Code Snippets to Show (if time permits):**

1. **Smart Contract** (`lib.rs`):
```rust
// Pyth oracle integration
pub fn get_usd_value_from_sol(sol_lamports: u64, price_feed: &AccountInfo) -> Result<u64> {
    // Load Pyth price feed
    let price_account: &SolanaPriceAccount = load_price_account(&price_account_data)?;
    
    // Convert SOL → USD
    let sol_amount = (sol_lamports as f64) / 1_000_000_000.0;
    let price_scaled = (price as f64) * 10f64.powi(expo);
    let usd_value = sol_amount * price_scaled;
    
    Ok((usd_value * 1_000_000.0) as u64) // Store with 6 decimals
}
```

2. **Frontend Conversion** (`formatters.ts`):
```typescript
import Decimal from 'decimal.js';

export function formatCollateralUSD(collateralRaw: number): string {
  const usdValue = new Decimal(collateralRaw).dividedBy(1_000_000);
  return `$${usdValue.toFixed(2)}`;
}
```

**Talking Points:**
- "Smart contract reads Pyth price feed on-chain"
- "Converts SOL → USD using live oracle data"
- "Frontend uses decimal.js for precision (no floating-point errors)"
- "Backend provides fallback price service"

---

### Part 5: Testing & Validation (30 seconds)

**What to Show:**
```bash
cd solana-sandbox
npx ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json tests/test-usd-collateral-display.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✔ should correctly convert raw USD value (6 decimals) to display value
✔ should correctly convert USD to SOL equivalent
✔ should handle edge cases correctly
✔ should validate lamports vs USD confusion does not occur
✔ should match format used by Drift Protocol

5 passing (36ms)
```

**Talking Points:**
- "Comprehensive test suite validates conversions"
- "Tests edge cases and prevents regression"
- "Follows Drift Protocol patterns"
- "Sandbox environment for safe testing"

---

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed (Great Story!)

### The $7M SOL Bug 🔥
**Before:**
```
Total Collateral: 7,619,097.822615 SOL ❌
```

**Root Cause:**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG: Treating USD (6 decimals) as lamports (9 decimals)
totalCollateral = value / 1e9;
```

**After:**
```
Total Collateral: $93.15 USD ✅
```

**The Fix:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Read value_usd field and divide by 1e6
const valueUsdBuffer = accountData.slice(41, 49);
const valueUsd = new BN(valueUsdBuffer, 'le');
totalCollateral = valueUsd.toNumber() / 1e6;
```

**Talking Points:**
- "Discovered bug during Pyth integration"
- "Consulted Solana experts via MCP for guidance"
- "Fixed in one evening"
- "Added tests to prevent regression"
- "Great example of expert-guided development"
