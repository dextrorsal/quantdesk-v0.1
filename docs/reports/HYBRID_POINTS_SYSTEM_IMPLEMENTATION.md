## 📊 **Hybrid Model Architecture**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Drift-Inspired)**
```sql
-- Season 1: Foundation (3 months)
Total Points Pool: 1,000,000 points
Focus: Core trading activities

Multipliers:
- Trading Volume: 1.00x base, 2.00x early user, 1.50x active user
- Deposits: 2.00x base, 2.50x early user, 1.75x active user  
- Staking: 3.00x base, 3.50x early user, 2.00x active user
- Insurance Fund: 5.00x base, 6.00x early user, 2.50x active user
```

### **Phase 2: Engagement (Hyperliquid-Inspired)**
```sql
-- Season 2: Engagement (3 months)
Total Points Pool: 1,500,000 points
Focus: Community engagement and retention

Multipliers:
- Trading Volume: 1.20x base, 1.80x early user, 1.60x active user
- Deposits: 2.20x base, 2.20x early user, 1.80x active user
- Staking: 3.20x base, 3.20x early user, 2.20x active user
- Insurance Fund: 5.20x base, 5.20x early user, 2.80x active user
```

### **Phase 3: Innovation (QuantDesk-Exclusive)**
```sql
-- Season 3: Innovation (3 months)
Total Points Pool: 2,000,000 points
Focus: AI integration and advanced features

Multipliers:
- Trading Volume: 1.50x base, 1.50x early user, 1.80x active user
- Deposits: 2.50x base, 2.00x early user, 2.00x active user
- Staking: 3.50x base, 2.50x early user, 2.20x active user
- Insurance Fund: 5.50x base, 3.00x early user, 2.50x active user
```

## 🏗️ **Database Schema**

### **Core Tables:**
1. **`points_allocation_periods`** - Manages seasons and allocation periods
2. **`activity_multipliers`** - Stores multipliers for each activity type per period
3. **`trading_metrics`** - Core trading statistics
4. **`trading_activity_log`** - Detailed activity tracking with period context

### **Key Functions:**
1. **`calculate_dynamic_points()`** - Calculates points based on dynamic allocation
2. **`process_trading_activity()`** - Processes activities and awards points
3. **`initialize_points_system()`** - Sets up default seasons and multipliers

---

## 🎯 **Dynamic Allocation System**

### **How It Works:**
1. **Activity Occurs:** User trades, deposits, stakes, etc.
2. **Period Check:** System identifies current active period
3. **Multiplier Lookup:** Gets multipliers for activity type and period
4. **User Bonus Check:** Determines if user qualifies for early/active bonuses
5. **Points Calculation:** Calculates points using dynamic formula
6. **Points Award:** Awards points to user and logs activity

### **Example Calculation:**
```sql
-- User trades $1,000 in Season 1
Base Points: $1,000 * 0.01 = 10 points
Early User Bonus: 10 * 2.00 = 20 points
Active User Bonus: 20 * 1.50 = 30 points
Community Bonus: 30 * 1.20 = 36 points
Total: 36 points
```
