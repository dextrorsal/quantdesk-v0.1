# BMAD-CLI Quick Reference for QuantDesk

## BMAD Commands for CLI Tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex)

### Core Command Structure
```bash
# Use natural language with role-based requests

"Quality specialist: Design test scenarios for high-risk trading logic with proper financial risk assessment"
```

## Quality Assurance (Test Architect Commands)

The BMAD QA agent commands work in CLI too:
```bash
"QA risk assessment: Identify implementation risks for automated liquidation system"
"QA test design: Create comprehensive test strategy for real-time portfolio rebalancing"
"QA trace requirements: Ensure all acceptance criteria have test coverage for trading features"
"QA NFR validation: Verify security, performance, and reliability requirements for critical trading operations"
```

## Project-Specific Context

### QuantDesk Trading Platform Context
- **Technology Stack**: React, Node.js, TypeScript, Solana, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Architecture**: 9-department system with 34+ backend routes, 25+ services
- **Key Features**: Perpetual trading, AI-powered analytics, real-time data ingestion
- **Risk Level**: High-stakes financial operations with comprehensive risk management

### BMAD Integration Benefits
- **Context Preservation**: Access to all department architecture automatically
- **Cross-Department Coordination**: Automatic dependency mapping between services
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in test architecture and quality gates
- **Development Efficiency**: Targeted development with full system understanding

## Usage Examples

### Quick Bug Fixes (Claude CLI)
```bash
claude /dev "Fix the WebSocket connection issue in frontend portfolio updates"
claude /dev "Resolve the Oracle price feed integration error in backend"
claude /dev "Fix the MIKEY-AI agent context loading issue"
```

### Feature Development (Gemini CLI)
```bash
gemini /dev "Implement the real-time chart updates using Lightweight-charts library"
gemini /architect "Design the cross-department API for ML strategy deployment"
gemini /qa *risk "Assess risks for the automated rebalancing system"
```

### Code Refactoring (OpenAI Codex)
```bash
codex "Refactor the portfolio analytics service for better performance"
codex "Optimize the data ingestion pipeline for lower latency"
codex "Improve the smart contract gas efficiency for trading operations"
```

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start with cross-department context
" architect: Design the complete system architecture for new cryptocurrency listing feature including all department integration"

# Use department-specific expertise
" frontend: Implement the UI components for cryptocurrency listing with real-time updates"
"backend: Create the API endpoints for token validation, price feeds, and listing management" 
"smart contracts: Implement the smart contract logic for token listing with oracle price validation"
