# Early Tester Rewards

QuantDesk is launching with a referral-driven rewards system so early traders earn real value—not just points. Here’s how you and your crew benefit from joining the testing wave.

## Why Join Early

- **Fee Share for Referrers** – Earn 25–35% of the net trading fees generated by wallets you invite (Level 1), with an optional 5–10% on their referrals (Level 2) rolling out later.
- **Fee Discount for Traders** – Anyone who signs up through an invite link gets 10% off their own trading fees for the first 30 days.
- **Priority Access** – Early testers jump the waitlist, unlock private chat channels, and gain priority when new features go live.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Your Wallet** – Sign in with your Solana wallet; the first successful login with `?ref=<pubkey>` binds you to that referrer.
2. **Activate** – Complete a light usage threshold (e.g., 5 test trades or $10 simulated volume) so the system knows you’re real. Once activated, your referrer starts earning and your discount persists.
3. **Share Your Link** – Your dashboard surfaces a unique invite: `waitlist?ref=<your_pubkey>`. Share it anywhere; every activated trader expands your fee share.
4. **Track & Claim** – Weekly SOL payouts accrue in your “Referrals & Earnings” panel, with a transparent ledger mirrored to a Solana PDA for on-chain proof.

## Built-In Fair Play

- One wallet per signup; self-referrals and obvious farming patterns are removed automatically.
- Referral earnings and discounts run on a net-fee basis, ensuring the platform remains sustainable while still giving back ~35%.
- Caps, rate limits, and audit trails keep the system healthy as volume scales.

## Future Perks

- **Badges & Leaderboards** – Soulbound badges, alpha drops, and weekly spotlights for the most engaged testers.
- **Alert Multipliers** – Higher referral tiers unlock richer MIKEY insights and custom alert routing.
- **Token-Ready** – Payouts start in SOL and can pivot to future QuantDesk tokens once mainnet incentives launch.

## What You Get Today

- A convertible fee income stream tied to real trading activity.
- Immediate savings on your own trades when you join through a friend.
- Recognition inside the community as QuantDesk scales from devnet to mainnet.
