# Early Tester Rewards

QuantDesk is launching with a referral-driven rewards system so early traders earn real value—not just points. Here’s how you and your crew benefit from joining the testing wave.

## Why Join Early

- **Fee Share for Referrers** – Earn 25–35% of the net trading fees generated by wallets you invite (Level 1), with an optional 5–10% on their referrals (Level 2) rolling out later.
- **Fee Discount for Traders** – Anyone who signs up through an invite link gets 10% off their own trading fees for the first 30 days.
- **Priority Access** – Early testers jump the waitlist, unlock private chat channels, and gain priority when new features go live.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Your Wallet** – Sign in with SIWS (Solana In-App Web3 Signing); the first successful login with `?ref=<pubkey>` binds you to that referrer.
2. **Activate Referral** – Call the activation endpoint with your referrer's pubkey and minimum volume threshold.
3. **Track Earnings** – View referral summary via `/api/referrals/summary` showing count and earnings.
4. **Claim Rewards** – Post to `/api/referrals/claim` to receive SOL payouts directly to your wallet via Solana transaction.

## Built-In Fair Play

- Wallet-based authentication ensures one account per wallet address
- Self-referrals prevented through automated system checks
- Referral earnings calculated via `/api/referrals/preview` before activation
- All referral activity tracked in database with audit trails
- Rate limiting protects the referral system from abuse

## Future Perks

- **Badges & Leaderboards** – Soulbound badges, alpha drops, and weekly spotlights for the most engaged testers.
- **Alert Multipliers** – Higher referral tiers unlock richer MIKEY insights and custom alert routing.
- **Token-Ready** – Payouts start in SOL and can pivot to future QuantDesk tokens once mainnet incentives launch.

## What You Get Today

- A convertible fee income stream tied to real trading activity.
- Immediate savings on your own trades when you join through a friend.
- Recognition inside the community as QuantDesk scales from devnet to mainnet.
