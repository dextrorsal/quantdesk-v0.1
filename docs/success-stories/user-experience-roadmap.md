## üöÄ Phase 1 ‚Äì Social Onboarding & Presence

**Goal:** help traders showcase their activity and connect with others.

- Enhanced wallet onboarding (multi-wallet support, persistent sessions).
- Trader profiles with username, bio, performance badges, and shareable highlights.
- Leaderboards and activity feeds for top PnL, consistency, and win streaks.
- Optional social links (X, Telegram) for real-time notifications and community sharing.
