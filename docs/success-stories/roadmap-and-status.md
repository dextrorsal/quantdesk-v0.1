# QuantDesk Build Status & Roadmap

QuantDesk spans the terminal UI, backend services, smart data ingestion, and MIKEY intelligence. This roadmap captures the current footprint and the path toward the full ‚Äúperpetual trading command center‚Äù vision.

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Running Today

### Trading Experience
- Perp terminal with market boards, execution desk, risk dashboard, and MIKEY insight cards.
- Wallet-driven authentication, sub-accounts, and collateral tracking surfaced in the UI.
- Supabase + Redis-backed APIs handling orders, portfolios, and live WebSocket updates.

### Data & Intelligence Pipeline
- Redis-stream backbone collecting price ticks, whale activity, news, and user telemetry.
- Dedicated collectors for Pyth prices, Solana whale flows, and curated news feeds.
- MIKEY intelligence layer translating those streams into summaries, alerts, and chat responses.

### Platform Reliability
- Row Level Security enforced across Supabase tables with rate limits and audit logs.
- Dockerized worker fleet, observability dashboards, and CI checks protecting deployments.
- RPC load balancer blueprint implemented for multi-provider Solana connectivity.

## üöß Focus Areas in Flight

### Data Warehouse & Alerting
- Analytics writer service aggregating Redis streams into long-term analytics tables.
- Configurable routing so MIKEY alerts can push to Slack, Discord, and terminal notifications simultaneously.

### Trading Workflow Enhancements
- Expanded market coverage (additional SOL perps, cross listings) with deeper funding history overlays.
- Customizable risk templates and portfolio presets for different trading styles.

### Deployment & Operations
- Hardened staging ‚Üí production promotion scripts, including automated secret management.
- Health checks and alerting for ingestion workers, RPC latency, and WebSocket uptime.

## üîÆ Coming Up Next

### Intelligence Expansion
- Coinglass, CryptoQuant, and Arkham integrations to enrich MIKEY‚Äôs market context.
- Pattern recognition tying whale flows to perp funding and liquidation cascades.

### Experience Layer
- Unified ‚Äúmission control‚Äù dashboard marrying smart money data, MIKEY insights, and trade stats.
- Mobile companion for monitoring risk, positions, and alerts on the go.

### Automation & Advanced Analytics
- Strategy tagging with performance breakdowns inside the trade journal.
- API hooks for partners who want to automate order execution or analytics (without exposing proprietary MIKEY prompts).

## Stay in the Loop

- Check the in-terminal changelog for each feature release.
- Join the community chat for rollout notices and direct feedback.
- Watch this roadmap‚Äîmilestones move from ‚Äúin flight‚Äù to ‚Äúlive‚Äù as the platform evolves.

QuantDesk is a large, multi-service platform: the terminal you see today is backed by production ingestion pipelines, MIKEY intelligence, and hardened infrastructure. Each iteration tightens that loop between data, insights, and execution so traders get a truly professional Solana perp experience.
