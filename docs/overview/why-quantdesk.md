# Why QuantDesk? – The Professional Perpetual Trading Terminal

🚀 **QuantDesk delivers a serious, production-ready trading terminal for on-chain perpetual markets—built to prove reliability to traders and technical reviewers.**

## 🎯 Why Traders Need QuantDesk

### The Reality of Perpetual DEX Trading
- **Fragmented liquidity** spread across multiple protocols
- **Volatile markets** that demand sub-second response times
- **Signal overload** from on-chain data, news, and sentiment streams
- **Operational risk** when infrastructure goes down during major moves

### How We Respond
QuantDesk unifies data, execution, and monitoring into a single terminal:
- **Data Layer**: Live order books, funding, and depth from Pyth Network oracles and Solana-native perp venues
- **Execution Layer**: Hardened APIs with SIWS authentication, backend services, Supabase database, and WebSocket pipelines for instant order routing
- **Intelligence Layer**: MIKEY surfaces market structure insights powered by LangChain and multi-LLM routing

## 🏗️ Architecture at a Glance

| Layer | What It Includes | Why It Matters |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| **Data Ingestion** | Solana RPC streams, Pyth Network oracles, news feeds | Consistent real-time data flow under heavy load |
| **Core Services** | Node/TypeScript backend, Supabase (PostgreSQL), Redis (optional cache) | Durable storage with low-latency operations |
| **Realtime Delivery** | Socket.IO WebSockets, event broadcasting, alerting | Traders see market moves the instant they happen |
| **Terminal UI** | React + Vite dashboard with professional layouts | Traders get the Bloomberg-style experience for DeFi |
| **AI Assistant** | LangChain integration with multi-LLM routing | MIKEY provides intelligent market analysis and insights |

Everything is modular: APIs can be consumed by our own terminal or by teams who need institutional integrations.

## 🤝 Built for Teams, Traders, and Stakeholders

- **Active DEX Traders** – monitor depth, funding, spreads, and risk from one console
- **Quant Funds & Market Makers** – evaluate how we surface on-chain liquidity without exposing proprietary parameters
- **Due Diligence Teams** – audit the stability of our backend stack without needing access to our private code

## 🔒 Trust Without Revealing IP

- **Non-custodial by design** – wallet-based authentication (SIWS), keys stay with the trader
- **Session security** – HTTP-only cookies with 7-day expiration for secure authentication
- **Observability-first** – metrics, logging, and Grafana dashboards built for production reliability  
- **Security posture** – Supabase role policies, rate-limited APIs (per-minute), and transaction verification keep infrastructure hardened
