2. **PGP Encryption**: Use our PGP key for sensitive reports
3. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private security advisory system
4. **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 24 hours

### **What to Include**

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Affected versions and configurations
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include PoC code (privately)

### **PGP Key**

```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP Key will be provided separately]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```
