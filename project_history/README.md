 # Project History — Solana Perp Desk Evolution

 QuantDesk has shifted from experimental CEX algo bots to a Solana-first perp trading desk. This history captures the milestones that shaped the current terminal, data fabric, and community programs.

 ## Key Milestones

 - **On-Chain Commitment (Q3 2025):** Retired Bitget/CEX connectors and rebuilt custody around Solana PDAs and vaults.<br>
 ↳ See [`Architecture at a Glance`](/html/docs_core-features/architecture-at-a-glance.html) and [`Data & Storage Blueprint`](/html/docs_security-trust/data-and-storage-blueprint.html).

 - **Terminal Reinvention (Q3 2025):** Delivered the keyboard-driven command palette, multi-account controls, and MIKEY overlays for pro traders.<br>
 ↳ See [`Perp Terminal Toolbox`](/html/docs_trading-capabilities/perp-terminal-toolbox.html) and [`Terminal Shortcuts`](/html/docs_trading-capabilities/terminal-shortcuts.html).

 - **MIKEY Intelligence Layer (Q3 2025):** Unified whale flow, news, and oracle feeds into a single desk experience.<br>
 ↳ See [`Meet MIKEY`](/html/docs_ai-engine/meet-mikey.html) and [`Market Intelligence Pipeline`](/html/docs_ai-engine/market-intelligence-pipeline.html).

 - **Community & Rewards (Q4 2025):** Rolled out early tester incentives, referral loops, and Lite mode to widen access.<br>
 ↳ See [`Early Tester Rewards`](/html/docs_success-stories/early-tester-rewards.html) and [`Start Trading in 5 Minutes`](/html/docs_getting-started/start-trading-in-5-minutes.html).

 - **Enterprise Safeguards (Q4 2025):** Hardened admin monitoring, Redis namespacing, and uptime workflows for institutional desks.<br>

## Archived Research & Legacy Notes

Earlier documentation covering CEX arbitrage bots, CSV storage, and GPU-accelerated model pipelines now lives in the archive for historical reference. Key artifacts worth revisiting:

### Architecture Foundations
- [`Solana Perpetual DEX Architecture`](/html/docs_archive/architecture/SOLANA_PERPETUAL_DEX_ARCHITECTURE.html) – first principles of the on-chain engine.
- [`Hybrid Web2 ↔ Web3 Blueprint`](/html/docs_archive/architecture/web2-web3-arch.html) – bridging RPC services with PDAs.
- [`Redis Namespacing Guide`](/html/docs_archive/architecture/redis.html) – cache hygiene that still informs failover.
- [`Domain Layout for quantdesk.app`](/html/docs_archive/architecture/domain-structure.html) – canonical routing plan for Pro, Lite, and Docs.

### Trading Systems & Terminal Evolution
- [`Trading Overview`](/html/docs_archive/trading/overview.html) – captures the jump from bots to the unified desk.

- [`Perp Market Gap Analysis`](/html/docs_archive/analysis/REAL_PERPDEX_ANALYSIS_MISSING_COMPONENTS.html) – checklist that drove the Solana rebuild.

### Operations & Data Fabric
- [`Architecture Overview`](/html/docs_archive/operations/QUANTDESK_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.html) – service-to-service map pre refactor.
- [`Comprehensive Data Strategy`](/html/docs_archive/operations/COMPREHENSIVE_DATA_STRATEGY.html) – raw data plumbing notes.

### Security & Governance
- [`Security Guide`](/html/docs_archive/security/SECURITY_GUIDE.html) – early security posture audit.
- [`Security Improvements Summary`](/html/docs_archive/security/SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.html) – tracks mitigations we shipped.
- [`Comprehensive Security Audit`](/html/docs_archive/security/COMPREHENSIVE_SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.html) – full controls inventory.
- [`Admin Dashboard Access`](/html/docs_archive/admin/ADMIN_DASHBOARD_ACCESS.html) – routing and gating history.

### Community & Onboarding
- [`Early Tester Overview`](/html/docs_archive/onboarding/EARLY_TESTER_OVERVIEW.html) – origin of the rewards loop.
- [`Referral Program`](/html/docs_archive/onboarding/REFERRAL_PROGRAM.html) – incentive mechanics by cohort.
- [`Runbook`](/html/docs_archive/onboarding/RUNBOOK.html) – legacy setup steps that inform today’s Lite onboarding.

### Analysis & Postmortems
- [`Implementation Summary`](/html/docs_archive/analysis/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.html) – executive snapshot of the first rebuild.
- [`Backend Features Missing From Smart Contracts`](/html/docs_archive/analysis/BACKEND_FEATURES_MISSING_FROM_SMART_CONTRACTS.html) – backlog that led to PDA automation.
- [`Setup Analysis`](/html/docs_archive/analysis/SETUP_ANALYSIS_MISSING_COMPONENTS.html) – gaps closed during the devnet push.

These archives preserve the groundwork while keeping the active docs focused on the live Solana perp experience.
