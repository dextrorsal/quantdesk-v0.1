description: Rule 1. Core Design Rules (AI Stack Alignment). Rule 1.1 Treat the LLM as the Foundational Brain Use a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct from Hugging Face) as the core for reasoning and natural language processing. Fine-tune it on Solana-specific tasks like interpreting transaction data or generating NFT metadata. Avoid over-relying on the LLM for executionâ€”pair it with agent frameworks for autonomy. Rule 1.2 Select an Agent Framework as the Operating System Integrate with frameworks like Eliza for multi-platform bots (e.g., Twitter/X integration) or LangGraph (via Hugging Face) for managing agent behaviors, memory, and context. For Solana, use Eliza's Solana plugin for actions like minting NFTs on demand. Rule 1.3 Use Domain-Specific Kits as Apps Leverage kits like Solana Agent Kit for pre-built Solana tools (e.g., creating NFT collections, minting NFTs, swapping tokens). Ensure compatibility with Hugging Face by wrapping kit functions as tools in smolagents. For cross-chain perpetuals, incorporate GOAT Toolkit plugins like Jupiter swaps or Meteora liquidity pools. Rule 1.4 Maintain Modularity Build the agent to handle multiple tasks autonomously (e.g., execute transactions, monitor activity, interact with smart contracts). Use Hugging Face's PEFT (e.g., LoRA) to fine-tune only task-specific adapters, keeping the base LLM general.
