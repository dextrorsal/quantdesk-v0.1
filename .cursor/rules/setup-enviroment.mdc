description: Rule 2. Setup and Environment Rules. Rule 2.1 Node.js and Dependency Management Require Node.js 23.x.x (install via nvm). Use pnpm for dependencies like @langchain/core, @langchain/openai, solana-agent-kit, and bs58. Ensure package.json matches the guide's structure for reproducibility. Rule 2.2 Environment Configuration Always use a .env file for secrets (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY, SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY as base58-encoded, RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com). Parse private keys securely in code (e.g., via bs58.encode). For Hugging Face, add HF_TOKEN for model access. Rule 2.3 Wallet and Key Generation Generate Solana keys with solana-keygen grind --starts-with ai:1. Fund wallets with devnet SOL via faucets. For fine-tuning, simulate wallet interactions in datasets (e.g., synthetic transaction queries). Rule 2.4 IDE Recommendation Use a modern IDE like Cursor for AI-assisted debugging. This aligns with Hugging Face workflows for notebook-based fine-tuning.
