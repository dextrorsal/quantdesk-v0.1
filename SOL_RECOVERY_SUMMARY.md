## üõ†Ô∏è How to Reclaim SOL

### Option 1: Check if We Have Authority
1. Check if your wallet (`solana address`) matches the program authority
2. If yes, you can:
   - Upgrade the old program to add a `withdraw_vault` instruction
   - OR close the entire program (if no longer needed)

### Option 2: Check Program Instructions
The old program might already have a withdrawal instruction. Check:
```bash
anchor idl fetch GcpEyGMJg9AvEx8LgAyzyUNTPWFxovHxtmQ4vVWuWu3a
```

### Option 3: Close Entire Program
If you have upgrade authority and don't need the program:
1. Upgrade program with empty buffer (closes it)
2. This will refund all rent to the authority
3. **Note**: This closes the program permanently!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Vault is a PDA**: Cannot withdraw without program instruction
2. **Need Authority**: Must have upgrade authority to modify program
3. **Check Instructions**: Program might have existing withdraw instruction
4. **3.13 SOL**: Significant amount worth recovering!

## üìã Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Verify wallet matches program authority
2. ‚úÖ Check if program has withdraw/close instructions
3. ‚úÖ Consider if program is still needed
4. ‚úÖ If reclaimable, create instruction or upgrade
