# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created (required before drafting stories)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Under SM review (via review-story workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'

  # Demo Polish Stories (Styling Only - Need Validation)
  demo-sprint-story-1-visual-theme: review  # Styling complete, needs integration validation
  demo-sprint-story-2-proterminal-layout: review  # Styling complete, needs functionality validation
  demo-sprint-story-3-trading-forms: review  # Styling complete, needs end-to-end validation
  demo-sprint-story-4-mikey-chat-ui: review  # Styling complete, needs backend validation
  demo-sprint-story-5-demo-data-prep: backlog  # Story file exists, not in previous sprint status
  demo-sprint-story-6-record-demo-video: backlog  # Story file exists, not in previous sprint status

notes:
  - Sprint 1 focuses on Epic 1 (Advanced Orders) with 3 stories ready for development
  - Demo stories (1-4) show styling complete but integration NOT validated
  - MUST validate demo functionality before considering stories complete
  - All acceptance criteria documented per story file
  - Architecture guidance available in docs/architecture.md
  - Implementation pattern: databaseService only, custom error classes, tiered rate limiting
  - ⚠️ RISK: Demo may not actually work despite "complete" status
  - Priorities set: Critical (Epics 0, 1, 2, Demo), High (Epic 3), Medium (Epic 4), Low (Epic 5)
  - "WIP policy: in-progress limit 3 (scope: critical); active -> 1-1-monitor-conditional-orders, 1-2-redis-enable, 0-validate-demo-functionality"
  - 🎉 RECENT WIN: Epic 0 Story 0-5 (QM Quote Monitor) completed - Pyth/Oracle integration working, showing correct prices in Pro Terminal
  - Epic 0 (Trading E2E) - All 10 stories drafted (files created 2025-10-30)
  - Missing files added to sprint status: 1-4-authoritative-price-hub, demo-sprint-story-5, demo-sprint-story-6, STORY_fix-sol-collateral-deposit
