2. **Multi-Venue Feature** - Not currently planned for perps
   - **Decision:** Keep as future enhancement if demand exists
   - **Alternative:** Use aggregators for spot trading only

3. **Mainnet Migration** - Moving from devnet to mainnet requires testing
   - **Mitigation:** Gradual rollout, comprehensive testing first

### Open Questions

1. What is the optimal timeline for mainnet deployment?
2. Which advanced order type should be prioritized?

## Positioning & Branding

### "Bloomberg Terminal for Crypto" - Honest Assessment

**Reality Check (7/10 on Bloomberg comparison):**

**What QuantDesk Delivers:**
- ✅ Professional customizable interface (terminal-like)
- ✅ Real-time market data at appreciable speeds
- ✅ Comprehensive tools (trading, analysis, news)
- ✅ AI-powered insights and suggestions
- ✅ Portfolio management with analytics
- ✅ Much better UX than typical crypto tools (especially for solo dev)

**Where We Don't Match Bloomberg:**
- ❌ Not 100K-member institutional resources
- ❌ Not as fast or polished as Bloomberg infrastructure
- ❌ Advanced tools still in development
- ❌ Less sophisticated charts/visualizations

**Accurate Positioning:**
"Professional Trading Platform" or "Terminal-like Experience" better describes current state. The vision is Bloomberg-level, but we're delivering solid professional tools now.
