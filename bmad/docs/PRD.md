# QuantDesk Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Author:** Dex  
**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Project Level:** Level 3 (Complex System)  
**Target Scale:** Professional Trading Platform

---

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Complete advanced order types (stop-loss, take-profit, trailing stops) to enable professional risk management
- Enhance AI assistant capabilities with more sophisticated market analysis and trade suggestions
- Prepare for mainnet deployment with hardened infrastructure and comprehensive testing
- Acquire and support 100+ active beta users to validate product-market fit
- Polish existing features and architecture for production-grade reliability

### Background Context

QuantDesk is a beta perpetual DEX platform deployed on Solana devnet. The platform successfully consolidates fragmented DeFi tools into a unified interface, addressing the "multiple tabs problem" that traders face. The infrastructure is 95% complete with sophisticated architecture (layered monolith backend, modular smart contracts, separate AI service). However, advanced order types remain scaffolded and need completion, AI capabilities need enhancement, and the platform requires hardening for mainnet deployment.

The problem matters now because Solana DeFi is experiencing explosive growth with perpetual DEX volume increasing 300%+ in 2024. Traders need professional tools immediately to compete with institutions, and the market timing is critical as perpetual trading adoption accelerates.
