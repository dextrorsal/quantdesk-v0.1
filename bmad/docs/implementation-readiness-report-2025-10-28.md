# Implementation Readiness Report

Date: 2025-10-28
Project: QuantDesk
Level: 3 (Solutioning)
Prepared by: BMAD Gate Check

## 1) Executive Summary
Status: Ready with Conditions
Confidence: High
Rationale: PRD, updated architecture, and stories are present and largely aligned. No critical contradictions found. A few pre-sprint tasks are recommended to tighten execution.

## 2) Document Inventory (Discovered)
- PRD: `bmad/docs/PRD.md` (exists)
- Architecture: `docs/architecture.md` (validated, 85%, no critical issues)
- Tech Spec: `bmad/docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md` (exists)
- Epics/Stories: `bmad/docs/epics-summary.md`, `bmad/docs/STORY_1_IMPLEMENTATION.md` … `STORY_4_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (exist)
- UX Artifacts: `bmad/docs/UX_DESIGN_SYSTEM_REVIEW.md`, `bmad/docs/UX_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (exist)
- Status: `bmad/docs/bmm-workflow-status.md` (exists)
- Sprint: `bmad/docs/sprint-status.yaml` (exists)
- Validation: `bmad/docs/validation-report-docs-architecture.md` (updated)

## 3) Alignment Validation (Cross-Reference)
- PRD ↔ Architecture: Aligned. Backend-centric oracle, layered monolith, and advanced orders path reflected in both.
- Architecture ↔ Stories: Mostly aligned. Stories cover core trading, charts, and UX; ensure conditional orders monitoring and Redis enablement are explicitly tracked.
- PRD ↔ UX: Key UI behaviors present; minor polish tracked in UX docs.

## 4) Gap Analysis
- Monitoring Service for Conditional Orders: Present in architecture; ensure a dedicated story with ACs and load targets.
- Redis Enablement Plan: Architecture specifies cache TTLs; add a deploy/runbook task for production enablement and observability.
- Traceability Coverage: New table added; expand mapping to all PRD subsections during sprint planning.

## 5) Risks (and Mitigations)
- Operational Risk: Redis misconfiguration in prod → Mitigation: checklist and health probes.
- Performance Risk: Conditional monitor at scale → Mitigation: index and capacity targets documented; load-test story needed.
- Documentation Drift: Architecture changes during sprint → Mitigation: definition-of-done requires doc update.

## 6) Recommendations (Pre‑Sprint Tasks)
1. Create stories: conditional order monitor, Redis enablement, load test for monitor loop.
2. Add acceptance criteria tying PRD FRs to stories (traceability completion).
3. Add service health probes and dashboards tasks for Redis and monitor.

## 7) Readiness Decision
Decision: Ready with Conditions
Conditions to Track in Sprint Plan:
- Story for conditional order monitor with ACs and metrics
- Redis enablement and runbook
- Load testing story with pass/fail thresholds

- Architecture Validation: `bmad/docs/validation-report-docs-architecture.md`
- Current Workflow Status: `bmad/docs/bmm-workflow-status.md`
