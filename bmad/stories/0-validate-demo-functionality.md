# Story: Validate Demo Functionality & Integration

## Status
in-progress

## Summary
Validate that demo components (Pro Trading Terminal, MIKEY AI Chat, trading flow, positions display) are fully functional, integrated with backend, and ready for demo recording.

## Context
- Stories 1-4 were marked "complete" but only tracked CSS/styling changes
- Integration with backend services was not verified
- End-to-end user flows were not tested
- Demo readiness is uncertain

## Scope
- Verify Pro Trading Terminal initializes correctly
- Test trading flow (order entry, submission, execution)
- Validate positions display with real data
- Verify MIKEY AI chat connects to backend and returns meaningful responses
- Test account health and info displays
- Validate WebSocket connections work
- Test with real/realistic market data

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Pro Trading Terminal Initialization
   - Given user navigates to Pro Trading Terminal
   - When page loads
   - Then all panels initialize without errors (positions, order book, trades, charts)
   - And account balance/health displays correctly
   - And market selector shows available markets
2. Trading Flow Works End-to-End
   - Given user is on Pro Trading Terminal
   - When user enters order (market/limit, buy/sell, size)
   - And submits order
   - Then order appears in active orders table immediately
   - And backend receives order via API call
   - And order appears in order book if limit order
   - And execution updates appear in real-time via WebSocket
3. Positions Display Real Data
   - Given user has open positions
   - When positions table renders
   - Then all positions display with: symbol, side, size, entry price, current price, unrealized P&L, liquidation price
   - And account health metric is accurate
   - And liquidation risk indicator shows correctly
4. MIKEY AI Chat Connects to Backend
   - Given user opens MIKEY AI chat
   - When user sends a message about trading or market analysis
   - Then backend API call is made to `/api/ai/*` or `/api/chat/*`
   - And response is displayed in chat
   - And response is relevant and professional
   - And error handling works if backend is unavailable
5. WebSocket Real-Time Updates
   - Given user is on Pro Trading Terminal
   - When market prices change
   - Then positions table updates with new prices within <2 seconds
   - And unrealized P&L recalculates automatically
   - And order book depth updates in real-time
   - And trades feed shows new trades as they happen
6. Account Information Display
   - Given user is logged in
   - Then account balance displays correctly from backend
   - And available margin is calculated correctly
   - And total equity shows open position value
   - And leverage multiplier displays correctly
7. Demo Readiness
   - Given all above ACs are met
   - Then record a 5-minute demo showing: login → trading → positions → AI chat → different markets
   - And demo flows smoothly without errors
   - And all data appears realistic/real (not dummy data unless API unavailable)

## Tasks/Subtasks

## Non-Goals
- Adding new features (this is validation/testing only)
- Style changes (already done in Stories 1-4)
- Backend API changes (verify existing APIs work)

## Files to Check
- `frontend/src/pro/index.tsx` - Pro Terminal main component
- `frontend/src/components/Positions.tsx` - Positions table
- `frontend/src/components/trading/*.tsx` - Trading components
- `frontend/src/components/MikeyAIChat.tsx` - AI chat
- Backend routes: `/api/positions/*`, `/api/orders/*`, `/api/ai/*`, `/api/chat/*`
- WebSocket service: `backend/src/services/websocket.ts`

## Testing Approach
1. Manual testing: Run app, test each flow end-to-end
2. Check browser console for errors/warnings
3. Check Network tab for API calls and WebSocket connections
4. Verify data is real (not hardcoded) by checking API responses
5. Try different scenarios: different markets, different order types

## Definition of Done
- All ACs pass manual testing
- Zero console errors during demo flow
- All API calls return real data
- WebSocket connects and receives updates
- Demo video can be recorded showing smooth, working terminal
- If issues found, create follow-up stories to fix them

## Priority
**CRITICAL** - Must validate before considering demo complete

## Risks
- Backend might be returning dummy/placeholder data
- WebSocket might not be configured properly
- MIKEY AI might not be connecting to real backend
- Database might not have realistic test data
- Authentication might not be working properly
