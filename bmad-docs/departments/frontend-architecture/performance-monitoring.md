# Performance Monitoring

## Performance Metrics
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor bundle size and chunk optimization
- **Load Time**: Track initial load time and time to interactive
- **Runtime Performance**: Monitor component render times
- **Memory Usage**: Track memory usage and potential leaks

## Optimization Strategies
- **Code Splitting**: Implement route-based and component-based code splitting
- **Lazy Loading**: Use React.lazy for component lazy loading
- **Memoization**: Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- **Image Optimization**: Optimize images and use appropriate formats
