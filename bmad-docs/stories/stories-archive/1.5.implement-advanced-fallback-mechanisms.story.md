# Story 1.5: Implement Advanced Fallback Mechanisms

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** QuantDesk developer,  
**I want** advanced fallback mechanisms that intelligently try multiple affordable providers before escalating to expensive models,  
**so that** we maximize cost efficiency while ensuring reliable service delivery.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Intelligent fallback that tries multiple affordable providers in optimal order
2. Provider health monitoring and automatic exclusion of failing providers
3. Circuit breaker pattern for providers that consistently fail
4. Fallback logic considers both cost and quality in provider selection
5. Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
6. Fallback mechanisms maintain 99.9% service availability
