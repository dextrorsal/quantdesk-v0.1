# Story 1.1: Implement Cost-First Routing Logic

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** QuantDesk developer,  
**I want** the router to prioritize affordable premium models (Mistral, Z.ai GLM, Gemini, Claude) before expensive models,  
**so that** we can achieve dramatic cost efficiency improvements while maintaining quality.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The selectBestProvider() method prioritizes providers by cost tiers (affordable premium first, then expensive models)
2. Cost tiers are configurable via environment variables
3. Existing task-specific routing logic is preserved but enhanced with cost optimization
4. All existing provider integrations continue to work without modification
5. Cost-first routing reduces average request cost by 60%+ compared to current implementation
6. Quality threshold system maintains 85%+ user satisfaction with response quality
