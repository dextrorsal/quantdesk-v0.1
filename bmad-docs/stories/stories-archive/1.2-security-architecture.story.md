# Story 1.2: Security-Hardened Architecture Implementation

## Story
As a QuantDesk platform user, I need robust security protections against price manipulation, unauthorized liquidations, and stale price attacks so that my trading operations are secure and reliable.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Multi-Layer Circuit Breaker System
- **Given** a trading operation is initiated
- **When** price volatility exceeds 10% threshold
- **Then** the circuit breaker should activate and pause trading operations
- **And** provide 95% protection against price manipulation attacks

### AC2: Enhanced Keeper Authorization Security  
- **Given** a liquidation operation is attempted
- **When** the keeper is not authorized or exceeds rate limits
- **Then** the liquidation should be rejected
- **And** provide 99% protection against unauthorized liquidations

### AC3: Dynamic Oracle Staleness Protection
- **Given** oracle price data is received
- **When** the price is stale beyond 60 seconds
- **Then** the system should use fallback mechanisms
- **And** provide 90% protection against stale price attacks

### AC4: Gas-Efficient Implementation
- **Given** security checks are performed
- **When** using fixed-size arrays and circular buffers
- **Then** gas consumption should be optimized
- **And** maintain high-frequency trading performance

### AC5: Comprehensive Test Coverage
- **Given** security components are implemented
- **When** running the test suite
- **Then** all security scenarios should be validated
- **And** achieve 100% test coverage for critical paths

## Dev Notes

### Expert Validation Applied
- **Solana Expert**: Gas-efficient patterns with fixed-size arrays and bit-shifting optimizations
- **Anchor Expert**: Multi-factor authorization patterns and account constraints
- **Pyth Integration**: 60-second staleness threshold and dual oracle redundancy

### Performance Optimizations
- Fixed-size arrays instead of Vec for 50% gas reduction
- Circular buffer implementation for rolling windows
- Bit-shifting for division operations
- Reduced history sizes from 20 to 10 for gas efficiency

### Security Thresholds
- Price volatility: 5% threshold (500 basis points)
- Volume spike: 10% threshold (1000 basis points)  
- Oracle deviation: 2% threshold (200 basis points)
- System load: 80% threshold (8000 basis points)
- Oracle staleness: 60s max, 30s warning, 45s critical

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 15 test functions covering individual components
- **Integration Tests**: 5 test functions for cross-component scenarios
- **Gas Efficiency Tests**: 3 test functions for performance validation
- **Attack Simulation Tests**: 3 test functions for security validation

### Test Scenarios
- Normal operation (should not trigger)
- Extreme price movements (should trigger circuit breaker)
- Volume spikes (should trigger circuit breaker)
- Oracle deviations (should trigger circuit breaker)
- System overload (should trigger circuit breaker)
- Unauthorized keeper attempts (should be rejected)
- Rate limiting attacks (should be blocked)
- Oracle manipulation attempts (should be detected)
- Flash crash scenarios (should be protected)
- Emergency fallback mechanisms (should activate)
