## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: Current Implementation Analysis
```bash
# Analyze current implementation
cd contracts/programs/quantdesk-perp-dex/src
```

**Analysis Points:**
- Stack usage in `security.rs` (KeeperSecurityManager)
- Instruction organization in `instructions/` module
- State management in `state/` module
- Security features in `security.rs`
- CPI implementation in `cross_program.rs`

### Task 2: Backup Implementation Analysis
```bash
# Analyze backup implementation
cd contracts/programs/quantdesk-perp-dex/src
# Compare with lib.rs.backup
```

**Analysis Points:**
- Stack usage patterns
- Instruction organization
- State management approach
- Security implementation
- CPI usage patterns

### Task 3: Expert Validation
**Solana Expert Questions:**
1. "Analyze the current QuantDesk smart contract implementation for stack usage optimization. The KeeperSecurityManager is using 12KB+ stack space, exceeding Solana's 4KB limit. What are the best practices for reducing stack usage while maintaining functionality?"

2. "Compare two QuantDesk implementations - one with program ID C2T3UnvGdHwEkspXJG7JyAhwo6VKQEKjN6eCq69guYSw and another with HsSzXVuSwiqGQvocT2zMX8zc86KQ9TYfZFZcfmmejzso. Which approach is better for a perpetual DEX and why?"

**Anchor Expert Questions:**
1. "Evaluate the QuantDesk smart contract architecture for Anchor best practices. We have overlapping implementations and need to consolidate. What are the key considerations for choosing the best approach?"

2. "Analyze the CPI implementation in QuantDesk contracts. We have enhanced CPI with monitoring vs. basic CPI. Which approach is better for production trading platform?"

### Task 4: Performance Benchmarking
```bash
# Run performance tests on both implementations
cd contracts
anchor test --skip-local-validator
```

**Benchmark Metrics:**
- Stack usage per function
- Compute unit consumption
- Execution time
- Memory usage
- Test coverage
