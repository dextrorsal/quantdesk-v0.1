### Test Design Recommendations

Based on comprehensive coverage analysis:

1. **Test Coverage is Complete**: All ACs have unit, integration, and E2E coverage
2. **Risk Mitigation**: All critical risks have dedicated test scenarios
3. **Test Levels Appropriate**: Unit tests for logic, integration for services, E2E for user journeys
4. **Test Data Requirements**: Mock smart contracts, Oracle feeds, and database operations

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: All critical risks have dedicated test coverage
- **Medium Risk**: All medium risks have appropriate test coverage
- **Low Risk**: All low risks have basic test coverage

### Quality Indicators

âœ… **Excellent traceability demonstrated:**
