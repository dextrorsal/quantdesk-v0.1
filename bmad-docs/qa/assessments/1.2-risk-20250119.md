- New order types are added
- Smart contract integration patterns change
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
- Performance issues are reported
- User fund safety incidents occur

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### Testing Priority

1. **Run critical risk tests first** - Integration, security, and data integrity
2. **Additional test types needed** - Penetration testing, chaos engineering
3. **Test environment requirements** - Full integration environment with monitoring

### Development Focus

1. **Code review emphasis** - Order execution logic, validation, error handling
2. **Additional validation** - Comprehensive input validation, authorization checks
3. **Security controls** - Rate limiting, audit trails, atomic operations

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Phased rollout** - Deploy to limited users first
2. **Feature flags** - Enable/disable order execution features
3. **Rollback procedures** - Quick rollback to previous version

### Monitoring Setup

1. **Metrics to track** - Order success rates, execution times, error rates
2. **Alerts to configure** - Execution failures, security violations, fund safety
3. **Dashboard requirements** - Real-time order execution monitoring

## Integration with Quality Gates

**Gate Decision Criteria:**
- **Critical risks (score 9)**: TECH-001, SEC-001, DATA-001 → Gate = FAIL
- **High risks (score 6)**: TECH-002, SEC-002, PERF-001, BUS-001 → Gate = CONCERNS
- **Overall risk score 45/100** → High risk story requiring comprehensive mitigation

**Recommendation**: Address all critical risks before proceeding with implementation.
