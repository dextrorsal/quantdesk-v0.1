# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing QuantDesk's smart contracts system. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of new features while ensuring seamless integration with the existing sophisticated multi-program architecture.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements the existing QuantDesk contracts architecture by defining how new components will integrate with the current CPI-based multi-program system. Where conflicts arise between new and existing patterns, this document provides guidance on maintaining consistency while implementing enhancements.

## Existing Project Analysis

**Current Project State:**
- **Primary Purpose:** Sophisticated Solana-based perpetual DEX with multi-program architecture
- **Current Tech Stack:** Rust/Anchor Framework 0.32.1, Solana 2.1.0, CPI-based modular design
- **Architecture Style:** Multi-program CPI architecture with specialized programs (Core, Trading, Collateral, Security, Oracle)
- **Deployment Method:** Anchor-based deployment with program splitting strategy

**Available Documentation:**
- Comprehensive CPI architecture documentation
- Expert-validated security module implementation
- Detailed struct guides for all major components
- Program splitting strategy documentation
- Security circuit breaker implementation
- Cross-collateralization system design

**Identified Constraints:**
- Anchor framework limitation with embedded Cargo 1.79.0 (affecting `edition2024` features)
- Stack overflow mitigation through program splitting
- Gas optimization requirements for Solana execution
- Multi-program coordination complexity
- Security-first architecture with circuit breakers
