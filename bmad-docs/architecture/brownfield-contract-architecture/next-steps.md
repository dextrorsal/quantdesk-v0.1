# Next Steps

## Story Manager Handoff

**Reference:** This architecture document provides the foundation for QuantDesk contracts enhancement
**Key Integration Requirements:** 
- Maintain CPI-based multi-program architecture
- Preserve existing security-first design patterns
- Follow established PDA and state management conventions
- Integrate with existing circuit breaker and oracle systems

**First Story Implementation:** Begin with enhanced order management system, ensuring seamless integration with existing `order_management.rs` module and maintaining full backward compatibility.

**Integration Checkpoints:**
- Verify CPI communication patterns work correctly
- Validate PDA account creation and management
- Test security integration with existing circuit breakers
- Confirm oracle integration maintains existing patterns

## Developer Handoff

**Reference:** This architecture document and existing coding standards from QuantDesk contracts analysis
**Integration Requirements:** 
- Follow existing Anchor instruction patterns and module organization
- Maintain existing error handling and validation approaches
- Preserve existing event emission and logging patterns
- Extend existing security patterns rather than replacing them

**Key Technical Decisions:** 
- Use existing CPI patterns for inter-program communication
- Extend existing state modules rather than creating parallel systems
- Maintain gas optimization standards established in existing codebase
- Follow existing PDA derivation and management patterns

**Existing System Compatibility:** 
- All new instructions must maintain backward compatibility
- New accounts must follow existing PDA patterns and space allocation
- Enhanced features must integrate with existing security and oracle systems
- Performance must not exceed existing compute limits

**Implementation Sequencing:** 
1. Enhanced order management (extends existing order system)
2. Dynamic risk management (integrates with existing security)
3. Enhanced oracle integration (extends existing oracle system)
4. Comprehensive testing and validation

**Risk Mitigation:** 
- Incremental development with continuous testing
- Comprehensive devnet testing before mainnet deployment
- Rollback procedures using Anchor program upgrade mechanisms
- Enhanced monitoring and logging for new features
