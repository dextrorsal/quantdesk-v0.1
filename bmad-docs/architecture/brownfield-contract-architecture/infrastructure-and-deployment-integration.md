## Existing Infrastructure

**Current Deployment:** Anchor-based deployment with multi-program coordination
**Infrastructure Tools:** Anchor CLI, Solana CLI, Cargo build system
**Environments:** Localnet, Devnet, Testnet with consistent program IDs

## Enhancement Deployment Strategy

**Deployment Approach:** Incremental deployment preserving existing functionality
**Infrastructure Changes:** Minimal - uses existing Anchor deployment pipeline
**Pipeline Integration:** Extends existing build and test processes

## Rollback Strategy

**Rollback Method:** Anchor program upgrade with previous version restoration
**Risk Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing on devnet before mainnet deployment
**Monitoring:** Enhanced logging and event monitoring for new features
