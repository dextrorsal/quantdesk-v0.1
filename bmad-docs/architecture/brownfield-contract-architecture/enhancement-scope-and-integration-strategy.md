# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

## Enhancement Overview

**Enhancement Type:** Smart Contract System Enhancements
**Scope:** Modular additions to existing CPI-based multi-program architecture
**Integration Impact:** Medium - New components will integrate through existing CPI patterns and PDA structures

## Integration Approach

**Code Integration Strategy:** 
- Follow existing CPI patterns for inter-program communication
- Maintain modular instruction organization by domain (market_management, position_management, etc.)
- Extend existing state modules rather than creating parallel structures
- Preserve security-first architecture with circuit breaker integration

**Database Integration:**
- Extend existing PDA-based account structures
- Maintain compatibility with current state management patterns
- Follow established bump seed and space allocation conventions
- Preserve existing account derivation patterns

**API Integration:**
- Maintain existing Anchor instruction patterns
- Follow established error handling and validation approaches
- Preserve existing event emission patterns
- Extend current admin function patterns

**UI Integration:**
- Maintain existing instruction interfaces for frontend compatibility
- Preserve current account structure patterns for UI data binding
- Follow established event patterns for real-time updates

## Compatibility Requirements

- **Existing API Compatibility:** All new instructions must follow existing Anchor patterns and maintain backward compatibility
- **Database Schema Compatibility:** New accounts must follow existing PDA patterns and space allocation conventions
- **UI/UX Consistency:** New features must integrate seamlessly with existing frontend patterns
- **Performance Impact:** Must maintain gas optimization standards and not exceed existing compute limits
