# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions

1. **Review with Product Owner** - Validate architecture against business requirements
2. **Begin story implementation** - Use Dev agent with this architecture as context
3. **Set up infrastructure** - Deploy services using documented deployment strategy

## Frontend Architecture

Since QuantDesk includes significant UI components, a separate Frontend Architecture Document should be created detailing:

- **Component architecture** and React patterns
- **State management** strategy (Redux/Zustand)
- **Real-time data** handling with WebSockets
- **Trading interface** specific requirements
- **AI integration** in the frontend

## Architecture Prompt for Frontend

Create a brief prompt to hand off to Architect for Frontend Architecture creation:

**Reference:** This backend architecture document provides the foundation for frontend development
**Key UI Requirements:** Professional trading terminal, real-time market data, AI chat interface, portfolio management
**Frontend-Specific Decisions:** React 18 with Vite, Tailwind CSS, WebSocket integration, Chart.js for trading charts
**Request:** Detailed frontend architecture focusing on trading interface, state management, and real-time data handling
