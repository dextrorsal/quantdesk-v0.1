- **Oracle Security**: Price validation with confidence and staleness checks
- **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate order execution

## User Story
**As a:** QuantDesk trader
**I want:** Secure authentication with proper JWT to RLS mapping and working smart contracts
**So that:** My trading operations are secure and execute reliably on-chain

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Criteria
- [x] JWT to RLS mapping correctly resolves `wallet_pubkey` to `users.id`
- [x] All database writes include proper `user_id` from request context
- [x] Pyth SDK dependency conflicts resolved in Anchor smart contracts
- [x] Manual Pyth deserialization implemented for on-chain price validation
- [x] Deterministic order matching with idempotency keys for on-chain execution

### Integration Requirements
- **Backend:** Enhanced `auth.ts` middleware with proper user resolution
- **Smart Contracts:** Working Anchor compilation with manual Pyth integration
- **Security:** RLS policies enforce user data isolation
- **Matching:** Deterministic order matching with transaction finality

### Cross-Department Dependencies
- **Dependency 1:** Supabase database schema with proper user mapping (Dep: Database)
- **Dependency 2:** Pyth Network feed accounts for manual deserialization (Dep: Smart Contracts)
- **Dependency 3:** Epic 1 test script validation for regression testing (Dep: Backend)

## Technical Context
### Current Architecture
The current authentication system has JWT to RLS mapping inconsistencies causing NULL `user_id` inserts. Smart contracts have Pyth SDK dependency conflicts preventing Anchor compilation. Order matching lacks deterministic behavior and idempotency protection.

### Department-Specific Context

#### Backend Context
- **Services:** `auth.ts` middleware, `matching.ts`, `orders.ts`, `positions.ts`
- **Authentication:** JWT token with `wallet_pubkey` claim, user resolution via database
- **Security Pattern:** All database operations must include proper `user_id` context

#### Smart Contracts Context
- **Program Functions:** Manual Pyth deserialization using `load_price_feed_from_account_info`
- **Account Types:** Pyth price feed accounts, user accounts, market accounts
- **Oracle Data:** Price, confidence, publishTime validation with staleness checks

#### Security Context
- **JWT Pattern:** `wallet_pubkey` â†’ `users.id` â†’ `auth.uid()` for RLS
- **User Context:** Request object includes `req.user.id` and `req.user.wallet_pubkey`
- **RLS Enforcement:** All policies use `auth.uid()` for user data access

## Implementation Details
### Development Tasks

#### Backend Tasks (8h)
1. Enhance `auth.ts` middleware to properly resolve user ID from JWT `wallet_pubkey`
2. Update all database operations to include `user_id` from request context
3. Add user context validation and error handling
4. Implement deterministic order matching algorithm with price-time priority
5. Add idempotency key support for on-chain execution
6. Ensure transaction finality before state updates
7. Add comprehensive authentication flow testing
8. Create user context propagation throughout backend services

#### Smart Contract Tasks (6h)
1. Resolve Pyth SDK dependency conflicts in `Cargo.toml`
2. Implement manual Pyth deserialization using `load_price_feed_from_account_info`
3. Add price staleness and confidence validation in smart contracts
4. Create integration test reading real devnet Pyth feed
5. Update `oracle.rs` with proper error handling and validation
6. Add idempotency key validation in smart contract instructions

#### Security Tasks (2h)
1. Security audit of JWT to RLS mapping implementation
2. RLS policy validation for user data isolation
3. Authentication flow security testing
4. Create security documentation for authentication patterns

### Integration Sequence

### Cross-Department Testing
- **Contract:** Epic 1 test script validation with new authentication
- **Data Flow:** User context consistency from JWT â†’ Database â†’ Smart Contract
- **Security:** RLS policy enforcement, user data isolation

## Quality Gates
### Key Performance Indicators

- **Error Rate:** < 0.1% authentication failures

### Security Requirements
- **Authentication:** JWT to RLS mapping prevents unauthorized access
- **Data Protection:** User context ensures data isolation
- **Audit Trail:** All operations logged with proper user context

## Risks and Mitigations
### Technical Risks
- **Risk 1:** JWT to RLS mapping breaking existing functionality - *Mitigation:* Comprehensive testing, Epic 1 validation, gradual rollout
- **Risk 2:** Smart contract Pyth SDK conflicts blocking compilation - *Mitigation:* Manual deserialization approach, extensive testing

### Integration Risks  
- **Risk 1:** User context propagation causing performance issues - *Mitigation:* Performance monitoring, caching optimization
- **Risk 2:** Idempotency implementation complexity - *Mitigation:* Simple key-based approach, comprehensive testing

## Rollout Strategy
### Deployment Phases
1. **Phase 1:** Backend authentication fixes (Day 1-2)
2. **Phase 2:** Smart contract Pyth integration (Day 3-4)
3. **Phase 3:** Security validation and testing (Day 5)

### Rollback Plan
- **Trigger:** Epic 1 test script failures or authentication errors
- **Procedure:** Revert to original auth middleware, restore Pyth SDK, restart services
- **Verification:** Epic 1 test script passes, authentication works correctly

## Success Metrics
- **User Metrics:** Zero authentication-related errors in Epic 1 test script
- **Technical Metrics:** JWT resolution < 100ms, smart contracts compile successfully
- **Business Metrics:** Platform security maintained, user data properly isolated

## Dev Notes
