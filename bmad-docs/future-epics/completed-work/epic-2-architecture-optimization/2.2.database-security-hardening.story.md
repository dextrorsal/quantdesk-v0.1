### ðŸ“Š **SECURITY IMPACT**
- **SQL Injection**: Completely prevented through fluent API usage
- **Data Access**: Secured with proper RLS policies using `auth.uid()`
- **Performance**: Monitored with 1000ms threshold alerts
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of database operations

## User Story
**As a:** QuantDesk platform administrator
**I want:** All database operations to use secure Supabase fluent APIs with proper RLS policies
**So that:** The platform is protected against SQL injection vulnerabilities and unauthorized data access

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Criteria
- [x] All `execute_sql` custom RPC calls removed from backend codebase
- [x] Supabase fluent APIs implemented for all database operations
- [x] RLS policies use `auth.uid()` consistently across all tables
- [x] Slow query monitoring alerts when database queries exceed 1000ms
- [x] Database performance optimized with proper indexing

### Integration Requirements
- **Backend:** All services use `supabaseService` fluent API methods
- **Database:** RLS policies standardized to `auth.uid()` pattern
- **Security:** Zero SQL injection vulnerabilities in codebase
- **Performance:** Database query P50 < 200ms with monitoring

### Cross-Department Dependencies
- **Dependency 1:** Supabase service role configuration for backend access (Dep: Database)
- **Dependency 2:** Epic 1 test script validation to ensure no regression (Dep: Backend)
- **Dependency 3:** Security audit of RLS policies and database access patterns (Dep: Security)

## Technical Context
### Current Architecture
The current system uses custom `execute_sql` RPC calls throughout the backend, creating SQL injection vulnerabilities and inconsistent RLS policy enforcement. The `supabaseService.ts` has been enhanced with fluent API methods, but many services still use the deprecated `query` method that calls `execute_sql`.

### Department-Specific Context

#### Backend Context
- **Services:** `matching.ts`, `pythOracleService.ts`, `orders.ts`, `positions.ts`, `markets.ts`, `accounts.ts`, `funding.ts`, `pnlCalculationService.ts`, `websocket.ts`, `mcpSupabaseService.ts`
- **Database Tables:** `orders`, `positions`, `trades`, `markets`, `users`, `oracle_prices`
- **Security Pattern:** All database operations must use `supabaseService` fluent APIs

#### Database Context
- **Tables:** `orders` (user_id, market_id, order_account, order_type, side, size, price, leverage, status), `positions` (user_id, market_id, side, size, entry_price, status), `trades` (user_id, order_id, fill_size, fill_price)
- **Indexes:** `idx_orders_side_price`, `idx_positions_user_market`, `idx_trades_user_time`
- **RLS Policies:** Must use `auth.uid()` for user data access, not direct wallet_pubkey

#### Security Context
- **RLS Pattern:** `auth.uid()` maps to `users.id` for secure data access
- **Query Pattern:** Fluent APIs prevent SQL injection, type-safe queries
- **Performance Pattern:** Query monitoring with 1000ms threshold alerts

## Implementation Details
### Development Tasks

#### Backend Tasks (12h)
1. Audit all services for `execute_sql` usage and replace with fluent APIs
2. Update `matching.ts` to use `supabaseService` fluent methods for all database operations

4. Update `orders.ts`, `positions.ts`, `markets.ts` routes to use fluent APIs
5. Update `accounts.ts`, `funding.ts`, `pnlCalculationService.ts` to use fluent APIs
6. Update `websocket.ts` and `mcpSupabaseService.ts` to use fluent APIs
7. Add query performance monitoring with timing wrapper
8. Create comprehensive unit tests for all fluent API methods
9. Add integration tests for RLS policy enforcement
10. Create database migration scripts for any schema optimizations

#### Database Tasks (4h)
1. Audit all RLS policies to ensure `auth.uid()` usage
2. Create missing indexes for performance optimization
3. Update RLS policies for `orders`, `positions`, `trades` tables

### Integration Sequence
1. **Phase 1:** Backend fluent API migration and testing (Backend)
2. **Phase 2:** Database RLS policy updates and performance optimization (Database)
3. **Phase 3:** Security audit and validation (Security)

## Testing Strategy
### Backend Testing
- **Unit Tests:** All fluent API methods, query performance, error handling
- **API Tests:** Database operation endpoints, RLS policy enforcement
- **Integration Tests:** End-to-end database operations, Epic 1 test script validation

### Database Testing
- **RLS Tests:** User data isolation, cross-user access prevention
- **Performance Tests:** Query optimization, index effectiveness
- **Security Tests:** SQL injection prevention, unauthorized access blocking

### Cross-Department Testing
- **Contract:** Epic 1 test script passes with new database patterns
- **Data Flow:** Database operations maintain data consistency
- **Performance:** Database query P50 < 200ms, monitoring alerts work

## Quality Gates
### Key Performance Indicators
- **Response Time:** Database query P50 < 200ms
- **Throughput:** Handle 1000+ concurrent database operations
- **Error Rate:** < 0.1% database operation failures

### Security Requirements
- **Authentication:** All database operations use proper user context
- **Data Protection:** RLS policies prevent unauthorized data access
- **Audit Trail:** All database operations logged with user context

## Risks and Mitigations
### Technical Risks
- **Risk 1:** Fluent API migration breaking existing functionality - *Mitigation:* Comprehensive testing, Epic 1 validation, gradual rollout
- **Risk 2:** RLS policy changes blocking legitimate access - *Mitigation:* Thorough testing, rollback procedures, user context validation

### Integration Risks  
- **Risk 1:** Database performance degradation during migration - *Mitigation:* Performance monitoring, index optimization, query analysis
- **Risk 2:** Security vulnerabilities in new patterns - *Mitigation:* Security audit, penetration testing, code review

## Rollout Strategy
### Deployment Phases
1. **Phase 1:** Backend fluent API migration (Day 1-3)
2. **Phase 2:** Database RLS policy updates (Day 4-5)
3. **Phase 3:** Security audit and performance optimization (Day 6)

### Rollback Plan
- **Trigger:** Epic 1 test script failures or database performance degradation
- **Procedure:** Revert to `execute_sql` function, restore original RLS policies, restart services
- **Verification:** Epic 1 test script passes, database performance restored

## Success Metrics
- **User Metrics:** Zero database-related errors in Epic 1 test script
- **Technical Metrics:** Database query P50 < 200ms, zero SQL injection vulnerabilities
- **Business Metrics:** Platform security score maintained at 95/100
