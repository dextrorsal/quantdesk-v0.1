# Gate Decision Criteria Applied:
# 1. Risk thresholds: No risks ≥ 6 → PASS
# 2. Test coverage: Architecture phase, tests defined → PASS  
# 3. Issue severity: No high severity issues → PASS
# 4. NFR statuses: All NFRs PASS → PASS

# Final Decision: PASS - Architecture is production-ready and comprehensive
