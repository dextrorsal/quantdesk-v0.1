# Gate Decision Summary
decision: "FAIL"
reason: "Critical integration and execution issues identified that pose significant risks to user funds and platform reliability"

# Top Issues
top_issues:
  - issue: "Backend/Smart Contract Synchronization Gap"
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    description: "Orders execute in backend but fail to create positions on-chain"
    impact: "User fund loss, inconsistent state"
    
  - issue: "Order Status Inconsistency"
    severity: "HIGH"
    description: "Frontend shows different order statuses than backend/smart contract"
    impact: "User confusion, potential exploitation"
    
  - issue: "Missing Error Handling"
    severity: "HIGH"
    description: "Insufficient error handling for order execution failures"
    impact: "System instability, fund loss"
    
  - issue: "Test Coverage Gaps"
    severity: "MEDIUM"
    description: "Critical order execution paths lack comprehensive testing"
    impact: "Undetected bugs, production failures"
