## Detailed Analysis

### Security Analysis
The order management system has critical security vulnerabilities that could lead to user fund loss. The lack of proper validation and rollback mechanisms creates significant risks that must be addressed immediately.

**Key Security Concerns**:
- Orders can execute without proper validation
- Failed position creation could lead to fund loss
- Race conditions in concurrent order processing
- No proper error recovery mechanisms

### Performance Analysis
While performance issues are not as critical as security concerns, they could impact user experience and system scalability. The redundant oracle calls and inefficient database queries should be addressed.

**Key Performance Concerns**:
- Oracle call redundancy
- Database query inefficiency
- WebSocket overload
- No caching mechanisms

### Reliability Analysis
The system's reliability is compromised by the lack of proper error handling and state management. The inconsistent state between backend and smart contract creates significant risks.

**Key Reliability Concerns**:
- Order execution failures not handled
- No rollback mechanisms
- Inconsistent state management
- No proper monitoring

### Maintainability Analysis
The codebase has maintainability issues that could impact future development and bug fixes. The inconsistent error handling and missing tests make it difficult to maintain.

**Key Maintainability Concerns**:
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Missing integration tests
- Complex order flow logic
- Poor code documentation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Must Fix)
1. **Fix Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Implement atomic order execution
   - Add comprehensive validation
   - Create proper error recovery

2. **Improve Reliability**
