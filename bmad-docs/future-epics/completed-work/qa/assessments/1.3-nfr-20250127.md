## Detailed Analysis

### Security Analysis
The position management system has critical security vulnerabilities that could lead to financial loss. The inconsistent P&L calculations and position state management create significant risks that must be addressed immediately.

**Key Security Concerns**:
- P&L manipulation risk due to inconsistent calculations
- Position state inconsistencies could be exploited
- Incorrect liquidation prices could cause unfair liquidations
- No proper error recovery mechanisms

### Performance Analysis
While performance issues are not as critical as security concerns, they could impact user experience and system scalability. The redundant calculations and inefficient database queries should be addressed.

**Key Performance Concerns**:
- P&L calculation redundancy
- Database query inefficiency
- Frontend re-render issues
- No caching mechanisms

### Reliability Analysis
The system's reliability is compromised by the lack of proper error handling and state management. The inconsistent state between backend and smart contract creates significant risks.
