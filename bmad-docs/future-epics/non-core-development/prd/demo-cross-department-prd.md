# AI Portfolio Rebalancing PRD - Cross-Departmental Demo

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Implement AI-powered portfolio rebalancing for automated risk management
- Provide real-time portfolio optimization recommendations
- Enable multi-asset strategy execution across frontend, backend, and smart contracts
- Integrate with existing oracle data for informed decision making

### Background Context  
QuantDesk users currently manage portfolios manually without AI assistance. This feature will leverage the MIKEY-AI system to provide intelligent rebalancing suggestions based on market conditions, user risk tolerance, and portfolio performance metrics. This showcases cross-departmental coordination between all system components.
