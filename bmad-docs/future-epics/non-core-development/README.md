# Non-Core Development Documentation Archive

This directory contains **documentation that doesn't provide context for core development work** (frontend, Supabase, Solana Anchor programs, backend).

## Archived Categories

### **AI-Related Documentation**
- **`ai-engine/`** - LLM Smart Router analysis and AI service documentation
- **`mikey-ai-architecture.md`** - AI service architecture

**Reason**: AI services are not part of core development focus (frontend, backend, smart contracts, database)

### **Admin Panel & Social API Documentation**
- **`accessibility-requirements.md`** - Admin panel accessibility requirements
- **`strategy/api-integration-specifications.md`** - Social API integrations
- **`strategy/user-journey-maps.md`** - Marketing and user experience documentation

**Reason**: Admin panel and social integrations are not core development focus

### **Strategy & Marketing Documentation**
- **`strategy/competitive-analysis.md`** - Competitive analysis
- **`strategy/competitive-positioning-strategy.md`** - Market positioning
- **`strategy/competitor-analysis.md`** - Competitor research
- **`strategy/market-research.md`** - Market research
- **`strategy/QUANTDESK_OPTIMIZATION_ACTION_PLAN.md`** - Strategic planning

**Reason**: Marketing and strategy documents don't provide development context

### **Demo & Cross-Department Documentation**
- **`prd/demo-cross-department-prd.md`** - Demo PRD for cross-department work

**Reason**: Demo documentation doesn't represent actual core development requirements

## ✅ **RESTORED TO CORE DEVELOPMENT**

The following directories were **RESTORED** to `docs/` because they ARE core development related:

- **`stories/`** - ✅ **RESTORED** - All user stories for frontend, backend, smart contracts, security
- **`qa/`** - ✅ **RESTORED** - All QA assessments, gates, and validation reports
- **`analysis/`** - ✅ **RESTORED** - Smart contract analysis, production guides, implementation analysis
- **`epics/`** - ✅ **RESTORED** - Architecture validation and hardening epics

**Reason**: These provide essential context for core development work (frontend, backend, smart contracts, database)

## Core Development Focus

**The remaining `docs/` directory now focuses on:**

### **Essential Development Context**
- **`prd-consolidated.md`** - Product requirements for development
- **`architecture-consolidated.md`** - System architecture for development
- **`architecture/`** - Technical architecture documents
- **`departments/`** - Department-specific architecture (backend, frontend, smart contracts, database)
- **`security/`** - Security implementation guides
- **`security-trust/`** - Security architecture
- **`technical-debt/`** - Technical debt documentation
- **`process/`** - BMad implementation process

### **Why This Cleanup Helps**
- ✅ **Focused Context**: AI agents get only relevant development context
- ✅ **Reduced Noise**: No confusion from marketing/strategy documents
- ✅ **Faster Loading**: Smaller context for AI agents
- ✅ **Clear Purpose**: `docs/` is purely for development context

## Summary

**Archived**: 7 files/directories (AI, admin panel, marketing, strategy)
**Restored**: 4 directories (stories, qa, analysis, epics) - 50+ core development files

This maintains focus on core development while preserving essential BMad Method documentation.
