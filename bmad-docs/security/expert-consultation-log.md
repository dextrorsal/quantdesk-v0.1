# Expert Consultation Log

## Overview
This document tracks all expert consultations and their recommendations for the QuantDesk project. It serves as a historical record and reference for future development decisions.

## Consultation #1: Solana Architecture & Database Design

### Date: January 15, 2025
### Expert: Solana Expert via MCP Tools
### Topic: On-chain vs Off-chain Data Architecture

### Question Asked:
"In a Solana perpetual DEX using Anchor, which data should live on-chain in program accounts vs off-chain in PostgreSQL? We currently store positions, orders, trades, liquidations, funding_rates, oracle_prices in Postgres. Is this the correct architecture or should some be on-chain only? What's the best practice for data separation between on-chain state and off-chain analytics/history?"

### Expert Response Summary:
**Recommended Architecture: Hybrid Approach**

#### Current State (Mirror in PostgreSQL):
- **Positions**: Mirror essential current state for fast UI queries
- **Orders**: Mirror active orders for order book display
- **Market Data**: Mirror current market state for UI performance
- **User Balances**: Mirror for fast balance checks

#### Historical Data (Store in PostgreSQL):
- **Trades**: All trade history for analytics
- **Order History**: Complete order lifecycle tracking
- **Liquidations**: Historical liquidation data
- **Funding Rates**: Historical funding calculations
- **Oracle Prices**: Historical price data for charts/analytics

#### Oracle Price Caching Strategy:
- Store Pyth oracle prices in PostgreSQL with public read access
- Oracle prices are public on-chain data, caching improves performance
- Keep current prices synchronized with on-chain state

#### User Privacy vs Blockchain Transparency:
- User positions and liquidations are public on Solana blockchain
- Database should protect user privacy with RLS policies
- Make aggregated data (total open interest, funding rates) public

### Implementation Impact:
- ✅ Confirmed current architecture approach
- ✅ Validated PostgreSQL storage for historical data
- ✅ Justified public read access for oracle prices
- ✅ Emphasized importance of RLS policies for user privacy

## Consultation #2: Anchor Framework & Event Synchronization

### Date: January 15, 2025
### Expert: Anchor Framework Expert via MCP Tools
### Topic: Event-Driven Synchronization and RLS Policies

### Question Asked:
"In our Anchor perpetual DEX with Position, Order, and Market accounts: Should PostgreSQL mirror current on-chain state exactly, or only store historical data and analytics while current state lives on-chain? How should we handle the sync between on-chain program accounts and off-chain database? What's the best practice for emitting Anchor events and indexing them to PostgreSQL with proper RLS policies?"

### Expert Response Summary:
**Recommended Synchronization Strategy: Event-Driven Architecture**

#### Event-Driven Architecture Benefits:
- Most reliable and scalable synchronization method
- Real-time updates without polling
- Efficient data transfer
- Built-in retry mechanisms

#### Implementation Approach:

1. **Anchor Events**: Emit events for all significant state changes
   ```rust
   #[event]
   pub struct OrderFilled {
       pub market: Pubkey,
       pub position_id: u64,
       pub order_id: u64,
       pub price: u64,
       pub quantity: u64,
       pub taker_fee: u64,
       pub maker_fee: u64,
   }
   ```

2. **Off-Chain Listener**: Subscribe to program events using Anchor event listeners
   ```typescript
   program.addEventListener("OrderFilled", async (event, slot, signature) => {
     await insertOrderFilledEvent(event, signature);
   });
   ```

3. **PostgreSQL Schema**: Create tables to store mirrored data and historical events
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE order_filled_events (
       signature VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
       slot BIGINT NOT NULL,
       market VARCHAR(44) NOT NULL,
       position_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
       order_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
       price BIGINT NOT NULL,
       quantity BIGINT NOT NULL,
       taker_fee BIGINT NOT NULL,
       maker_fee BIGINT NOT NULL,
       event_timestamp TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT (now() at time zone 'utc')
   );
   ```

4. **RLS Policies**: Control access to sensitive data
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view own order fills" ON order_filled_events
   FOR SELECT
   USING (market = current_user);
   ```

#### Key Considerations:
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in synchronization service
- **Idempotency**: Ensure database updates are idempotent
- **Security**: Protect database credentials and implement proper authentication
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test synchronization logic
- **Compute Budget**: Be mindful of compute budget when emitting events

### Implementation Impact:
- ✅ Validated event-driven synchronization approach
- ✅ Provided specific implementation examples
- ✅ Emphasized importance of error handling and idempotency
- ✅ Confirmed RLS policy approach for user data protection

## Consultation #3: Database Security & RLS Policies

### Date: January 15, 2025
### Expert: Combined recommendations from both experts
### Topic: Comprehensive RLS Policy Implementation

### Expert Consensus:
Both experts emphasized the importance of comprehensive RLS policies for protecting user data while maintaining public access to appropriate data.

#### Public Data (No RLS needed):
- `markets` - Market specifications
- `oracle_prices` - Public price data
- `funding_rates` - Public funding calculations
- `market_stats` - Aggregated market statistics

#### User-Specific Data (RLS Required):
- `positions` - Users can only see their own positions
- `orders` - Users can only see their own orders
- `trades` - Users can only see their own trades
- `liquidations` - Users can only see their own liquidations
- `user_balances` - Users can only see their own balances

#### Admin-Only Data (Service Role Only):
- `admin_users` - Admin authentication data
- `admin_audit_logs` - Admin action logs
- `system_events` - System debugging information

### Implementation Impact:
- ✅ Created comprehensive RLS policies
- ✅ Implemented service role isolation
- ✅ Protected sensitive admin data
- ✅ Maintained public access to appropriate data
