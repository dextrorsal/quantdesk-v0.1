**Frontend Integration Strategy:** Extend existing React frontend with new components for unified dashboard, social media feeds, and alpha channel integration.

**Testing Integration Strategy:** Extend existing test suite to include social media integration, news processing, and alpha channel functionality.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach:** Extend existing multi-service structure; add new integration modules alongside existing services.

**Naming Conventions:** Follow existing TypeScript/Node.js conventions; use descriptive names for integration functions and classes.

**Coding Standards:** Maintain existing TypeScript strict mode, ESLint configuration, and code formatting standards.

**Documentation Standards:** Update existing API documentation to include new integration endpoints and maintain inline code documentation.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration:** Integrate with existing pnpm workspace build process; no changes to deployment pipeline required.

**Deployment Strategy:** Deploy as part of existing multi-service architecture; maintain existing Vercel/Railway deployment strategy.

**Monitoring and Logging:** Extend existing Winston logging to include social media processing, news analysis, and alpha channel monitoring.

**Configuration Management:** Use existing .env configuration system; add new environment variables for API keys and integration settings.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks:** 
- Social media API rate limits could impact real-time updates
- News sentiment analysis accuracy could affect trading decisions
- Alpha channel integration complexity could impact performance

**Integration Risks:**
- External API dependencies could introduce service failures
- Real-time data synchronization could create consistency issues
- Multiple data sources could create information overload
