# Problem Statement

## Current State and Pain Points

The QuantDesk smart contract codebase exhibits several critical issues that compromise system reliability and developer productivity:

**Variable Naming Inconsistency**: The codebase contains conflicting naming conventions for identical concepts:
- `solana_pub_key` vs `solana_address` for wallet identifiers
- `wallet_address` vs `wallet_pubkey` in database schemas
- Inconsistent parameter naming across smart contract functions

**Testing Infrastructure Gaps**: Current testing framework is insufficient for a production trading platform:
- Missing comprehensive unit tests for smart contract functions
- No integration tests for contract interactions
- Lack of security tests for vulnerability detection
- Insufficient performance tests for gas optimization

**Code Redundancy and Organization**: Smart contracts contain redundant patterns that increase maintenance burden:
- Duplicate error handling logic across functions
- Repeated validation patterns without abstraction
- Inconsistent code structure across similar operations

**Technical Debt Impact**: These issues create significant risks:
- **Financial Risk**: P&L calculation inconsistencies between backend and smart contracts
- **Security Risk**: Position state inconsistencies could be exploited
- **Maintenance Risk**: Inconsistent patterns increase development time and error probability

## Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Current approaches fail to address the root causes:
- **Manual Testing**: Insufficient for complex DeFi operations requiring precise financial calculations
- **Ad-hoc Naming**: No standardized conventions lead to confusion and errors
- **Code Duplication**: Increases maintenance burden and introduces inconsistencies

## Urgency and Importance

This project is critical because:
- **User Fund Safety**: Inconsistent P&L calculations pose direct risk to user funds
- **Platform Reliability**: Position management issues could cause unfair liquidations
- **Development Velocity**: Standardized code reduces development time and errors
- **Production Readiness**: Current technical debt prevents confident production deployment
