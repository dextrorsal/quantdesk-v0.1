# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions

1. **Resolve Solana Toolchain Issues**: Address Rust version conflicts to enable smart contract compilation
2. **Establish Variable Naming Standards**: Create and document consistent naming conventions
3. **Design Testing Framework Architecture**: Plan comprehensive testing infrastructure
4. **Create Code Organization Guidelines**: Establish patterns for eliminating redundancy
5. **Begin Unit Test Implementation**: Start with core smart contract functions

## PM Handoff

This Project Brief provides the full context for QuantDesk Smart Contract Testing Framework & Code Standardization. Please start in 'PRD Generation Mode', review the brief thoroughly to work with the user to create the PRD section by section as the template indicates, asking for any necessary clarification or suggesting improvements.

The project addresses critical technical debt identified in Epic 1 development and QA reviews, focusing on establishing production-ready smart contract infrastructure with comprehensive testing coverage and standardized code organization.
