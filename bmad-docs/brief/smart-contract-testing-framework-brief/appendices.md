# Appendices

## A. Research Summary

**Current State Analysis**:
- Epic 1 development completed with backend-centric architecture
- Smart contract compilation blocked by Rust version conflicts
- Critical QA findings indicate P&L calculation inconsistencies
- Position management issues pose significant user fund risks

**Technical Debt Assessment**:
- Variable naming inconsistencies across codebase
- Missing comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Code redundancy in smart contract functions
- Insufficient security testing coverage

**Security Audit Findings**:
- Critical security vulnerabilities in smart contract architecture
- Insecure wallet management practices
- Insufficient testing coverage for production deployment
- Environment variable management inconsistencies

## B. Stakeholder Input

**Development Team**: Need standardized testing framework to reduce debugging time and ensure code quality
**QA Team**: Require comprehensive test coverage to validate smart contract functionality
**Security Team**: Need automated security testing to identify vulnerabilities early
**Product Team**: Require reliable smart contracts to support production trading platform
