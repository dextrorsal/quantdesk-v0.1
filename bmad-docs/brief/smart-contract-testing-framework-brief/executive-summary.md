# Executive Summary

QuantDesk is a sophisticated Solana-based perpetual DEX platform requiring comprehensive smart contract testing infrastructure and code standardization. The project addresses critical technical debt including inconsistent variable naming conventions (e.g., `solana_pub_key` vs `solana_address`), redundant code patterns, and missing testing frameworks that pose significant risks to user funds and platform reliability.

**Primary Problem**: Smart contracts lack proper testing infrastructure and suffer from inconsistent code organization, creating maintenance challenges and potential security vulnerabilities.

**Target Market**: Solana DeFi developers, trading platform operators, and institutional users requiring reliable perpetual trading infrastructure.

**Key Value Proposition**: Standardized, well-tested smart contract architecture that reduces technical debt, improves maintainability, and ensures fund safety through comprehensive testing coverage.
