# Risks & Open Questions

## Key Risks

- **Toolchain Limitations**: Current Rust version conflicts may prevent smart contract compilation
- **Integration Complexity**: Testing framework integration with existing systems may be complex
- **Performance Impact**: Comprehensive testing may slow development velocity initially
- **Security Gaps**: Testing framework may not catch all security vulnerabilities

## Open Questions

- How will testing framework integrate with current CI/CD pipeline?
- What level of test coverage is sufficient for production deployment?
- How will testing framework handle Solana-specific constraints (compute units, account limits)?
- What security testing tools are most effective for Solana smart contracts?

## Areas Needing Further Research

- Solana-specific testing best practices and tools
- DeFi security testing methodologies
- Performance optimization techniques for Solana smart contracts
- Integration patterns between testing framework and existing QuantDesk services
