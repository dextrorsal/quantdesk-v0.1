# MVP Scope

## Core Features (Must Have)

- **Variable Naming Standardization**: Implement consistent `wallet_pubkey` naming across all smart contracts and database schemas
- **Unit Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite covering all smart contract functions with edge cases
- **Integration Testing**: Test contract interactions and cross-contract calls
- **Security Testing**: Automated vulnerability detection for common DeFi attack vectors
- **Code Organization**: Eliminate redundant patterns through proper abstraction
- **Documentation**: Complete testing framework documentation and usage examples

## Out of Scope for MVP

- Performance optimization beyond basic gas efficiency
- Advanced monitoring and alerting systems
- Cross-chain testing capabilities
- Automated deployment testing
- Load testing for high-frequency scenarios

## MVP Success Criteria

The MVP is successful when:
- All smart contracts use consistent `wallet_pubkey` naming convention
- 80% test coverage achieved for core smart contract functions
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities in tested contracts
- All redundant code patterns eliminated through abstraction
- Complete testing framework documentation available
