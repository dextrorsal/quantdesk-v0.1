# Constraints & Assumptions

## Constraints

- **Budget**: Utilize existing development resources and infrastructure
- **Timeline**: Complete MVP within 4 weeks of Epic 1 completion
- **Resources**: Current development team with Solana expertise
- **Technical**: Must work with existing Solana toolchain limitations (Rust version conflicts)

## Key Assumptions

- Solana toolchain will be updated to resolve Rust version conflicts
- Current backend-centric architecture will remain functional during smart contract development
- Existing QuantDesk codebase patterns can be extended rather than rewritten
- Testing framework will integrate seamlessly with current development workflow
- Security audit findings will be addressed through testing framework implementation
