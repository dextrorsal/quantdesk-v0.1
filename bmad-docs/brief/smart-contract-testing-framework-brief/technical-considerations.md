# Technical Considerations

## Platform Requirements

- **Target Platforms**: Solana devnet and mainnet
- **Browser/OS Support**: Linux/macOS development environments
- **Performance Requirements**: Test execution time under 5 minutes for full suite

## Technology Preferences

- **Smart Contracts**: Rust with Anchor Framework
- **Testing Framework**: Anchor test framework with custom extensions
- **Code Quality**: Rustfmt, Clippy, and custom linting rules
- **Documentation**: Rustdoc with custom testing documentation
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment

## Architecture Considerations
