# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack

**Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust (Solana smart contracts)
**Frameworks:** Node.js 20+, Express.js, React 18, Anchor Framework
**Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL), Redis for caching
**Infrastructure:** Vercel (frontend), Railway/Vercel (backend), Solana devnet/mainnet
**External Dependencies:** Pyth Network, Twitter API, Discord API, Telegram API, News APIs

## Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy:** Leverage existing Supabase infrastructure for all data storage; use Redis for real-time caching and session management.

**API Integration Strategy:** Maintain existing RESTful API structure while adding new endpoints for social media, news, and alpha channel integration.

**Frontend Integration Strategy:** Extend existing React frontend with new components for unified dashboard, social media feeds, and alpha channel integration.

**Testing Integration Strategy:** Extend existing test suite to include social media integration, news processing, and alpha channel functionality.

## Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach:** Extend existing multi-service structure; add new integration modules alongside existing services.

**Naming Conventions:** Follow existing TypeScript/Node.js conventions; use descriptive names for integration functions and classes.

**Coding Standards:** Maintain existing TypeScript strict mode, ESLint configuration, and code formatting standards.

**Documentation Standards:** Update existing API documentation to include new integration endpoints and maintain inline code documentation.

## Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration:** Integrate with existing pnpm workspace build process; no changes to deployment pipeline required.

**Deployment Strategy:** Deploy as part of existing multi-service architecture; maintain existing Vercel/Railway deployment strategy.

**Monitoring and Logging:** Extend existing Winston logging to include social media processing, news analysis, and alpha channel monitoring.

**Configuration Management:** Use existing .env configuration system; add new environment variables for API keys and integration settings.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks:** 
- Social media API rate limits could impact real-time updates
- News sentiment analysis accuracy could affect trading decisions
- Alpha channel integration complexity could impact performance

**Integration Risks:**
- External API dependencies could introduce service failures
- Real-time data synchronization could create consistency issues
- Multiple data sources could create information overload

**Deployment Risks:**
- New integrations could affect existing functionality
- API key management could introduce security vulnerabilities
- Real-time processing could impact system performance

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout of new integrations
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Create rollback procedures for each integration phase
