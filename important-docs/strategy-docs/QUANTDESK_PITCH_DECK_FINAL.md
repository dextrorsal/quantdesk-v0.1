### **SLIDE 3: The Problem**
```
PROBLEM STATEMENT

Professional Traders Are Scattered Everywhere

Current tools force you to manage everything separately:

📍 Data Fragmentation
"All my data is in different places - 
hard to get, always switching tabs"

🔄 Constant Tab Switching  
"Swapping between DEX, charts, social, 
alerts, analytics constantly"

📱 Community Overload
"Checking Twitter, Telegram, Discord
to stay on top of sentiment and alerts"

📊 Analysis Paralysis
"How can I make informed decisions when 
I'm jumping between 10 different tools?"

Result: Information overload, missed opportunities, trading fatigue
```

**Visual Notes:**
- Use 4 boxes with icons (monitor, target, clock, star)
- Keep placeholder feel but replace with real pain points
- White text on dark background
- Icons for each box heading

**Talking Point:** *"Professional traders are drowning in tabs - DEX here, charts there, social media everywhere. You need everything in one place like a Bloomberg Terminal."*
