# Story 2.3: Comprehensive Documentation Review & Modernization

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story

**As a** QuantDesk stakeholder and developer,
**I want** all documentation to accurately reflect our current architecture, features, and refined scope,
**so that** users, investors, and developers have up-to-date information that matches our actual implementation and strategic direction.

## Strategic Context

**Current Situation:**
