# Smart Contract Security Enhancements - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **trading system administrator**,
I want **multi-layer circuit breakers for trading operations**,
so that **extreme market conditions don't compromise system stability**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: QuantDesk smart contracts and trading operations
- Technology: Rust, Anchor Framework, Solana programs
- Follows pattern: Existing security architecture in contracts/programs/quantdesk-perp-dex/src/security.rs
- Touch points: Trading functions, oracle price feeds, position management

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Implement price change circuit breakers with configurable thresholds
2. Create volume spike detection and protection mechanisms
3. Add position size limits and validation
4. Implement trading halt mechanisms for emergency situations

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing trading operations continue to work unchanged
6. New functionality follows existing security pattern
7. Integration with oracle feeds maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Change is covered by appropriate tests
9. Documentation is updated with security features
10. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing security.rs module with new circuit breaker functionality
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Current security architecture and error handling patterns
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain compatibility with existing trading operations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated with security enhancements

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Breaking existing trading operations
- **Mitigation:** Implement circuit breakers as optional features with configurable thresholds
- **Rollback:** Disable circuit breakers if needed

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible
