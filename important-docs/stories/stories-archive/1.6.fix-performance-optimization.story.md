# Story 1.6: Fix Performance Optimization

**Epic:** QuantDesk Core Trading Platform  
**Story ID:** 1.6  
**Priority:** LOW  
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days  
**Department:** Backend + Frontend  

## User Story

**As a** QuantDesk user  
**I want** the platform to be fast and responsive  
**So that** I can trade efficiently without delays

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Fix slow API responses** - All API calls respond quickly
2. **Fix slow UI rendering** - UI updates quickly and smoothly
3. **Fix memory leaks** - No memory leaks in long-running sessions
4. **Fix database queries** - Database queries are optimized
5. **Fix caching** - Appropriate caching is implemented

## Technical Tasks

- [ ] **Debug existing performance issues** in backend API
- [ ] **Fix slow database queries** in Supabase
- [ ] **Fix UI rendering performance** in React components
- [ ] **Fix memory leaks** in long-running sessions
- [ ] **Test performance improvements** end-to-end

## Technical Details

### Backend Issues to Fix
- **File:** All API routes
- **Issue:** Slow API responses
- **Root Cause:** Need to investigate existing performance bottlenecks

### Database Issues to Fix
- **File:** `backend/src/services/supabaseDatabase.ts`
- **Issue:** Slow database queries
- **Root Cause:** Need to optimize existing queries

### Frontend Issues to Fix
- **Files:** All React components
- **Issue:** Slow UI rendering
- **Root Cause:** Need to optimize existing components

## Dependencies

- **Depends on:** Story 1.5 (User Experience and Error Handling)
- **Blocks:** None (final story in epic)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All API calls respond quickly (< 200ms)
- [ ] UI updates quickly and smoothly
- [ ] No memory leaks in long-running sessions
- [ ] Database queries are optimized
- [ ] Appropriate caching is implemented
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Areas:**
- Performance optimizations
- Caching implementation
- Query optimization

**Mitigation:**
- Test thoroughly with load testing
- Implement monitoring for performance metrics
- Add performance benchmarks

## Notes

- **Focus on optimizing existing code, not creating new features**
- **Ensure performance improvements don't break functionality**
- **Test with realistic data volumes**
