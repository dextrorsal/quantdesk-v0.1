# Security Wallet Management Implementation - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **developer**,
I want **secure wallet management with role-based access**,
so that **private keys are protected and different system roles can operate safely**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: QuantDesk smart contracts and backend services
- Technology: Solana Web3.js, Anchor Framework, TypeScript
- Follows pattern: Existing wallet configuration in Anchor.toml and backend services
- Touch points: Smart contract interactions, API authentication, keeper operations

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Implement wallet manager utility supporting DEV, KEEPER, and ADMIN roles
2. Create secure keypair loading functions using file paths instead of hardcoded keys
3. Establish Base58 encoding/decoding utilities for consistent key handling
4. Implement wallet validation and health checks

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing smart contract deployment continues to work unchanged
6. New functionality follows existing environment variable pattern
7. Integration with backend services maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Change is covered by appropriate tests
9. Documentation is updated with security best practices
10. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Create new wallet-manager utility that can be imported by existing services
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follows current Anchor.toml wallet configuration pattern
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain backward compatibility with existing wallet configurations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated with security guidelines

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Breaking existing wallet functionality during transition
- **Mitigation:** Implement gradual migration with fallback to existing methods
- **Rollback:** Revert to hardcoded private keys if needed

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible
