# 5. Test access control and permissions
```

### Task 4: Production Deployment Preparation
```bash
# 1. Prepare mainnet deployment configuration
# 2. Set up production monitoring
# 3. Configure backup procedures
# 4. Document incident response procedures
# 5. Create production deployment checklist
```

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Feature Testing Failures
- **Risk**: Some trading features might not work correctly
- **Mitigation**: Expert analysis implementation is most complete, test thoroughly

### Risk 2: Performance Issues
- **Risk**: Performance might not meet requirements
- **Mitigation**: Expert analysis implementation already optimized, benchmark thoroughly

### Risk 3: Security Vulnerabilities
- **Risk**: Security features might have vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: Expert analysis implementation has enhanced security, test thoroughly

### Risk 4: Production Deployment Issues
- **Risk**: Production deployment might fail
- **Mitigation**: Test on devnet first, prepare comprehensive deployment procedures

## Timeline

- **Day 1**: Comprehensive feature testing
- **Day 2**: Performance validation and benchmarking
- **Day 3**: Security verification and testing
