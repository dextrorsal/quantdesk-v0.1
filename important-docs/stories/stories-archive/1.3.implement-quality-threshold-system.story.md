# Story 1.3: Implement Quality Threshold System

## Status
Done

## Story

**I want** intelligent quality thresholds that automatically escalate to expensive models when affordable models don't meet quality requirements,  
**so that** we maintain high-quality responses while optimizing costs.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Automatic escalation to expensive models when quality thresholds aren't met
3. Quality metrics are configurable and measurable
4. Fallback logic tries multiple affordable providers before escalating
