# Story 1.3: Implement Quality Threshold System

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** QuantDesk developer,  
**I want** intelligent quality thresholds that automatically escalate to expensive models when affordable models don't meet quality requirements,  
**so that** we maintain high-quality responses while optimizing costs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Quality threshold system monitors response quality metrics
2. Automatic escalation to expensive models when quality thresholds aren't met
3. Quality metrics are configurable and measurable
4. Fallback logic tries multiple affordable providers before escalating
5. Quality threshold system maintains 85%+ user satisfaction
6. Quality metrics are logged and tracked for analysis
