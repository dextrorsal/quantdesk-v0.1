# QuantDesk Monorepo Context Rules

## Project Structure Awareness
This is a **monorepo** containing multiple QuantDesk components. Always consider the full project structure, not just the current folder.

### Key Directories:
- `/home/dex/Desktop/quantdesk/` - Root monorepo directory
- `/home/dex/Desktop/quantdesk/data-ingestion/` - Current data ingestion pipeline
- `/home/dex/Desktop/quantdesk/backend/` - Main backend API server
- `/home/dex/Desktop/quantdesk/frontend/` - Frontend application
- `/home/dex/Desktop/quantdesk/` - Other components (check structure)

### Important Guidelines:
1. **Always check the full monorepo structure** when working on any component
2. **Look for existing implementations** in other directories before creating new ones
3. **Consider cross-component dependencies** and shared configurations
4. **Use absolute paths** when referencing files across the monorepo
5. **Check for shared environment variables** and configuration files
6. **Look for existing services** that might already solve the problem

### Data Ingestion Pipeline Context:
- **Purpose**: Collect real-time price data for QuantDesk trading platform
- **Components**: Price collectors, news scrapers, whale monitors, analytics writers
- **Data Flow**: External APIs → Redis Streams → PostgreSQL (Supabase)

### When Working on This Project:
- Always explore the full `/home/dex/Desktop/quantdesk/` directory structure
- Check if similar functionality exists in `/backend/` or other components
- Consider how changes affect the entire trading platform ecosystem
- Look for shared configurations, environment variables, and utilities
- Verify that solutions work across the entire monorepo, not just this component

### Example Commands to Explore Structure:
```bash
# Check full monorepo structure
ls -la /home/dex/Desktop/quantdesk/

# Look for similar implementations
find /home/dex/Desktop/quantdesk/ -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" | grep -i pyth
find /home/dex/Desktop/quantdesk/ -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" | grep -i price

# Check for shared configs
find /home/dex/Desktop/quantdesk/ -name "*.env*" -o -name "config.*"
```

Remember: This is a **trading platform monorepo** - always think about the bigger picture!
