# Collateral USD Conversion Fix

## Problem
- User deposited **0.01 SOL** (~$1.95-1.97 at current prices)
- UI displayed collateral as **$0.01** instead of **~$1.95**
- `totalCollateral` was stored/returned in **SOL** but displayed as if it was **USD**

## Root Cause
`getUserAccountState()` returned `totalCollateral` in SOL (0.01), but the UI components were displaying it directly as USD without conversion.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated `getUserAccountState()` in `smartContractService.ts`
- Now fetches current SOL price from oracle API (`/api/oracle/price/SOL`)
- Converts SOL collateral to USD: `totalCollateral = solCollateral * solPrice`
- Returns `totalCollateral` in **USD** instead of SOL
- Fallback price: $190 if oracle fails

### 2. Updated UI Display Components
- **AccountSlideOut.tsx**: Already displays USD correctly, added SOL equivalent display
- **EnhancedAccountPanel.tsx**: Fixed null safety for `totalCollateral`
- **DebugAccountState.tsx**: Added `.toFixed(2)` for proper USD formatting

## Result
✅ **0.01 SOL** × **~$190/SOL** = **~$1.90 USD** displayed correctly

## Note
The SOL equivalent calculation uses `190` as the price. For dynamic pricing, we should fetch SOL price in the component or use `unifiedBalanceService.getSOLPrice()`.
